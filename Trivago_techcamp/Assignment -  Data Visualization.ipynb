LovelaceA c. 1843 daguerreotype by Antoine Claudet[1]BornThe Hon. Augusta Ada Byron(1815-12-10)10 December 1815London, EnglandDied27 November 1852(1852-11-27) (aged\\xa036)Marylebone, London, EnglandResting placeChurch of St. Mary Magdalene, Hucknall, Nottingham, EnglandKnown\\xa0forMathematics, computingSpouse(s)William King-Noel, 1st Earl of LovelaceChildren\\nByron King-Noel, Viscount Ockham and 12th Baron Wentworth\\nAnne Blunt, 15th Baroness Wentworth\\nRalph King-Milbanke, 2nd Earl of Lovelace\\n\\nAugusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10\\xa0December 1815\\xa0– 27\\xa0November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage\\'s proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a \"computing machine\" and one of the first computer programmers.[2][3][4]\\nLovelace was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron and his wife Lady Byron.[5] All of Byron\\'s other children were born out of wedlock to other women.[6] Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later. He commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, \"Is thy face like thy mother\\'s my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?\".[7] He died of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada\\'s interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father\\'s perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.\\nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \"poetical science\"[8] and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\".[9]\\nWhen she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, also known as \"the father of computers\", and in particular, Babbage\\'s work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville.\\nBetween 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the calculating engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called Notes. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage\\'s personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine.[10] Lovelace\\'s notes are important in the early history of computers. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.[11] Her mindset of \"poetical science\" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.[6]\\nShe died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Biography\\n\\n1.1 Childhood\\n1.2 Adult years\\n1.3 Education\\n1.4 Death\\n\\n\\n2 Work\\n\\n2.1 First computer program\\n2.2 Insight into potential of computing devices\\n2.3 Controversy over her actual contribution\\n\\n\\n3 In popular culture\\n4 Commemoration\\n5 Bicentenary\\n6 Publications\\n7 Publication history\\n8 See also\\n9 Notes\\n10 References\\n11 Sources\\n12 Further reading\\n13 External links\\n\\n\\nBiography\\nChildhood\\n Ada Byron, aged four\\nLord Byron expected his child to be a \"glorious boy\" and was disappointed when Lady Byron gave birth to a girl.[12] The child was named after Byron\\'s half-sister, Augusta Leigh, and was called \"Ada\" by Byron himself.[13] On 16\\xa0January 1816, at Lord Byron\\'s command, Lady Byron left for her parents\\' home at Kirkby Mallory, taking their five-week-old daughter with her.[12] Although English law at the time granted full custody of children to the father in cases of separation, Lord Byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights,[14] but did request that his sister keep him informed of Ada\\'s welfare.[15]\\n\\n Ada Byron, aged seven, by Alfred d\\'Orsay, 1822, Somerville College, Oxford.\\nOn 21\\xa0April, Lord Byron signed the deed of separation, although very reluctantly, and left England for good a few days later.[16] Aside from an acrimonious separation, Lady Byron continued throughout her life to make allegations about her husband\\'s immoral behaviour.[17] This set of events made Lovelace infamous in Victorian society. She did not have a relationship with her father. He died in 1824 when she was eight years old. Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life.[18] Lovelace was not shown the family portrait of her father until her 20th birthday.[19]\\nLovelace did not have a close relationship with her mother. She was often left in the care of her maternal grandmother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke, who doted on her. However, because of societal attitudes of the time—which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation—Lady Byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about her daughter\\'s welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern.[20] In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to her daughter as \"it\": \"I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own.\"[21] Lady Byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for any sign of moral deviation. Lovelace dubbed these observers the \"Furies\" and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her.[22]\\n\\n Ada Byron, aged seventeen, 1832\\nLovelace was often ill, beginning in early childhood. At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision.[13] In June 1829, she was paralysed after a bout of measles. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, something which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite the illnesses, she developed her mathematical and technological skills. At the age of twelve, this future \"Lady Fairy\", as Charles Babbage affectionately called her, decided she wanted to fly. Ada Byron went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with imagination and passion. Her first step, in February 1828, was to construct wings. She investigated different material and sizes. She considered various materials for the wings: paper, oilsilk, wires, and feathers. She examined the anatomy of birds to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body. She decided to write a book, Flyology, illustrating, with plates, some of her findings. She decided what equipment she would need; for example, a compass, to \"cut across the country by the most direct road\", so that she could surmount mountains, rivers, and valleys. Her final step was to integrate steam with the \"art of flying\".[6]\\nIn early 1833, Ada Byron had an affair with a tutor. After being caught, she tried to elope with him but the tutor\\'s relatives recognised her and contacted her mother. Lady Byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal.[23] Lovelace never met her younger half-sister, Allegra, the daughter of Lord Byron and Claire Clairmont. Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five. Lovelace did have some contact with Elizabeth Medora Leigh, the daughter of Byron\\'s half-sister Augusta Leigh, who purposely avoided Lovelace as much as possible when introduced at court.[24]\\n\\n\\nAdult years\\n Watercolour portrait of Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, circa 1840, possibly by Alfred Edward Chalon\\nLovelace became close friends with her tutor Mary Somerville, who introduced her to Charles Babbage in 1833. She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville,[25] and they corresponded for many years. Other acquaintances included the scientists Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens. She was presented at Court at the age of seventeen \"and became a popular belle of the season\" in part because of her \"brilliant mind.\"[26] By 1834 Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and was able to charm many people, and was described by most people as being dainty, although John Hobhouse, Byron\\'s friend, described her as \"a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend\\'s features, particularly the mouth\".[27] This description followed their meeting on 24\\xa0February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably due to her mother\\'s influence, which led her to dislike all of her father\\'s friends. This first impression was not to last, and they later became friends.[28]\\nOn 8 July 1835, she married William, 8th Baron King, becoming Lady King.[29] They had three homes: Ockham Park, Surrey; a Scottish estate on Loch Torridon in Ross-shire; and a house in London. They spent their honeymoon at Worthy Manor in Ashley Combe near Porlock Weir, Somerset. The Manor had been built as a hunting lodge in 1799 and was improved by King in preparation for their honeymoon. It later became their summer retreat and was further improved during this time. From 1845, the family\\'s main house was East Horsley Towers, rebuilt in the Victorian Gothic fashion by the architect of the Houses of Parliament, Charles Barry.[30][31]\\nThey had three children: Byron (born 12\\xa0May 1836); Anne Isabella (called Annabella; born 22\\xa0September 1837); and Ralph Gordon (born 2\\xa0July 1839). Immediately after the birth of Annabella, Lady King experienced \"a tedious and suffering illness, which took months to cure.\"[28] Ada was a descendant of the extinct Barons Lovelace and in 1838, her husband was made Earl of Lovelace and Viscount Ockham,[32] meaning Ada became the Countess of Lovelace. In 1843–44, Ada\\'s mother assigned William Benjamin Carpenter to teach Ada\\'s children and to act as a \"moral\" instructor for Ada.[33] He quickly fell for her and encouraged her to express any frustrated affections, claiming that his marriage meant he would never act in an \"unbecoming\" manner. When it became clear that Carpenter was trying to start an affair, Ada cut it off.[34]\\nIn 1841, Lovelace and Medora Leigh (the daughter of Lord Byron\\'s half-sister Augusta Leigh) were told by Ada\\'s mother that her father was also Medora\\'s father.[35] On 27\\xa0February 1841, Ada wrote to her mother: \"I am not in the least astonished. In fact, you merely confirm what I have for years and years felt scarcely a doubt about, but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in any way suspected.\"[36] She did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron, but instead blamed Augusta Leigh: \"I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was.\"[37] In the 1840s, Ada flirted with scandals: firstly, from a relaxed approach to extra-marital relationships with men, leading to rumours of affairs;[38] and secondly, from her love of gambling. She apparently lost more than £3,000 on the horses during the later 1840s.[39] The gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends, and an ambitious attempt in 1851 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets. This went disastrously wrong, leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate, forcing her to admit it all to her husband.[40] She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosse\\'s son John from 1844 onwards. John Crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement. She bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her.[41] During her final illness, she would panic at the idea of the younger Crosse being kept from visiting her.[42]\\n\\nEducation\\nThroughout her illnesses, she continued her education.[43] Her mother\\'s obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age. She was privately schooled in mathematics and science by William Frend, William King,[a] and Mary Somerville, the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. One of her later tutors was the mathematician and logician Augustus De Morgan. From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge,[26] and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that her daughter\\'s skill in mathematics could lead her to become \"an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence\".[44]\\nLovelace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating poetry and science. While studying differential calculus, she wrote to De Morgan:\\n\\nI may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one\\'s elbows in one shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar[45]\\nLovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts. She valued metaphysics as much as mathematics, viewing both as tools for exploring \"the unseen worlds around us\".[46]\\n\\nDeath\\n Painting of Lovelace seated at a piano, by Henry Phillips (1852). Although in great pain at the time, she agreed to sit for the painting as her father, Lord Byron, had been painted by Phillips\\' father, Thomas Phillips.\\nLovelace died at the age of 36\\xa0– the same age at which her father had died\\xa0– on 27\\xa0November 1852,[47] from uterine cancer probably exacerbated by bloodletting by her physicians.[48] The illness lasted several months, in which time Annabella took command over whom Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and confidants. Under her mother\\'s influence, she had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor.[49] She lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on 30\\xa0August which caused him to abandon her bedside. It is not known what she told him.[50] She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque in Latin to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers.\\n\\nWork\\nThroughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including phrenology[51] and mesmerism.[52] After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844 she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings (\"a calculus of the nervous system\").[53] She never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a long-running pre-occupation, inherited from her mother, about her \\'potential\\' madness. As part of her research into this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments.[54] In the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron Karl von Reichenbach, Researches on Magnetism, but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft.[55] In 1851, the year before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning \"certain productions\" she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music.[56]\\n\\n Portrait of Ada by British painter Margaret Sarah Carpenter (1836)\\nLovelace first met Charles Babbage in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his difference engine.[57] She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could. Babbage was impressed by Lovelace\\'s intellect and analytic skills. He called her \"The Enchantress of Number\".[58][b] In 1843 he wrote to her:\\n\\n.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}Forget this world and all its troubles and if possible its multitudinous Charlatans—every thing in short but the Enchantress of Number.[58]\\n\\n\\nDuring a nine-month period in 1842–43, Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea\\'s article on Babbage\\'s newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine. With the article, she appended a set of notes.[59] Explaining the Analytical Engine\\'s function was a difficult task, as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment had shown little interest in it.[60] Lovelace\\'s notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine.[61] Her work was well received at the time; the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing.[62]\\nThe notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include (in Note G),[63] in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers using the Analytical Engine, which might have run correctly had it ever been built[64] (only Babbage\\'s Difference Engine has been built, completed in London in 2002).[65] Based on this work, Lovelace is now widely considered to be the first computer programmer[2] and her method is recognised as the world\\'s first computer program.[66]\\nNote G also contains Lovelace\\'s dismissal of artificial intelligence. She wrote that \"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.\" This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by Alan Turing in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\".[67]\\nLovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published, when he tried to leave his own statement (criticising the government\\'s treatment of his Engine) as an unsigned preface, which could have been mistakenly interpreted as a joint declaration. When Taylor\\'s Scientific Memoirs ruled that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper. The historian Benjamin Woolley theorised that: \"His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada\\'s involvement, and so happily indulged her\\xa0... because of her \\'celebrated name\\'.\"[68] Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12\\xa0August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as Philosopher\\'s Walk, as it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles.[62]\\n\\nFirst computer program\\n Lovelace\\'s diagram from \"note G\", the first published computer algorithm\\nIn 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his Analytical Engine. Luigi Menabrea, a young Italian engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy, transcribed Babbage\\'s lecture into French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the Bibliothèque universelle de Genève in October 1842.\\nBabbage\\'s friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea\\'s paper into English. She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage. These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea\\'s paper, were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor\\'s Scientific Memoirs under the initialism AAL.[69]\\nAda Lovelace\\'s notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason.[70][71] The engine was never completed so her program was never tested.[72]\\nIn 1953, more than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace\\'s notes on Babbage\\'s Analytical Engine were republished as an appendix to B.V. Bowden\\'s Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines.[73] The engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software.[64]\\n\\nInsight into potential of computing devices\\nIn her notes, Lovelace emphasised the difference between the Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines, particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity.[74] She realised the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crunching. In her notes, she wrote:\\n\\n[The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.[75][76]\\n\\nThis analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised. Walter Isaacson ascribes Lovelace\\'s insight regarding the application of computing to any process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles: \"When she saw some mechanical looms that used punchcards to direct the weaving of beautiful patterns, it reminded her of how Babbage\\'s engine used punched cards to make calculations.\"[77] This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley, as well as the programmer John Graham-Cumming, whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine.[78][79][80]\\n\\nAccording to the historian of computing and Babbage specialist Doron Swade: Ada saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see. In Babbage\\'s world his engines were bound by number...What Lovelace saw—what Ada Byron saw—was that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation—to general-purpose computation—and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper.[2]\\nControversy over her actual contribution\\nThough Lovelace is referred to as the first computer programmer, some biographers, computer scientists and historians of computing claim otherwise.\\nAllan G. Bromley, in the 1990 article Difference and Analytical Engines:\\n\\nAll but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Babbage from three to seven years earlier. The exception was prepared by Babbage for her, although she did detect a \\'bug\\' in it. Not only is there no evidence that Ada ever prepared a program for the Analytical Engine, but her correspondence with Babbage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so.[81]\\n\\nBruce Collier, who later wrote a biography of Babbage, wrote in his 1970 Harvard University PhD thesis that Lovelace \"made a considerable contribution to publicizing the Analytical Engine, but there is no evidence that she advanced the design or theory of it in any way\".[82]\\nEugene Eric Kim and Betty Alexandra Toole consider it \"incorrect\" to regard Lovelace as the first computer programmer, as Babbage wrote the initial programs for his Analytical Engine, although the majority were never published.[83] Bromley notes several dozen sample programs prepared by Babbage between 1837 and 1840, all substantially predating Lovelace\\'s notes.[84] Dorothy K. Stein regards Lovelace\\'s notes as \"more a reflection of the mathematical uncertainty of the author, the political purposes of the inventor, and, above all, of the social and cultural context in which it was written, than a blueprint for a scientific development\".[85]\\nIn his book, Idea Makers, Stephen Wolfram defends Lovelace\\'s contributions. While acknowledging that Babbage wrote several unpublished algorithms for the Analytical Engine prior to Lovelace\\'s notes, Wolfram argues that \"there\\'s nothing as sophisticated—or as clean—as Ada\\'s computation of the Bernoulli numbers. Babbage certainly helped and commented on Ada\\'s work, but she was definitely the driver of it.\" Wolfram then suggests that Lovelace\\'s main achievement was to distill from Babbage\\'s correspondence \"a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machine—something which Babbage never did.\"[86][self-published source?]\\nDoron Swade, a specialist on history of computing known for his work on Babbage, analyzed four claims about Lovelace during a lecture on Babbage\\'s analytical engine:\\n\\nShe was a mathematical genius\\nShe made an influential contribution to the analytical engine\\nShe was the first computer programmer\\nShe was a prophet of the computer age\\nAccording to him, only the fourth claim had \"any substance at all\". He explained that Ada was only a \"promising beginner\" instead of genius in mathematics, that she began studying basic concepts of mathematics five years after Babbage conceived the analytical engine so she could not have made important contributions to it, and that she only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it. But he agrees that Ada was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities.[87]\\n\\nIn popular culture\\n An illustration inspired by the A. E. Chalon portrait created for the Ada Initiative, which supported open technology and women\\nLovelace has been portrayed in Romulus Linney\\'s 1977 play Childe Byron,[88] the 1990 steampunk novel The Difference Engine by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling,[89] the 1997 film Conceiving Ada,[90] and in John Crowley\\'s 2005 novel Lord Byron\\'s Novel: The Evening Land, where she is featured as an unseen character whose personality is forcefully depicted in her annotations and anti-heroic efforts to archive her father\\'s lost novel.[91]\\nIn Tom Stoppard\\'s 1993 play Arcadia, the precocious teenage genius Thomasina Coverly (a character \"apparently based\" on Ada Lovelace—the play also involves Lord Byron) comes to understand chaos theory, and theorises the second law of thermodynamics, before either is officially recognised.[92][93] The 2015 play Ada and the Memory Engine by Lauren Gunderson portrays Lovelace and Charles Babbage in unrequited love, and it imagines a post-death meeting between Lovelace and her father.[94][95]\\nLovelace and Babbage are the main characters in Sydney Padua\\'s webcomic and graphic novel The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage. The comic features extensive footnotes on the history of Ada Lovelace, and many lines of dialogue are drawn from actual correspondence.[96]\\nLovelace and Mary Shelley as teenagers are the central characters in Jordan Stratford\\'s steampunk series, The Wollstonecraft Detective Agency.[97]\\nLovelace, identified as Ada Augusta Byron, is portrayed by Lily Lesser in the second season of The Frankenstein Chronicles.  She is employed as an \"analyst\" to provide the workings of a life-sized humanoid automaton.  The brass workings of the machine are reminiscent of Babbage\\'s analytical engine.  Her employment is described as keeping her occupied until she returns to her studies in advanced mathematics.[98]\\nAs of November 2015, all new British passports have included an illustration of Lovelace and Babbage on pages 46 and 47.[99][100]\\nIn 2017, a Google Doodle honoured her on International Women\\'s Day.[101]\\nLovelace and Babbage appear as characters in the second season of the ITV series Victoria (2017). Emerald Fennell portrays Lovelace in the episode, \"The Green-Eyed Monster\".[102]\\nThe Cardano platform uses ADA as the name for their cryptocurrency and Lovelace as the smallest sub-unit of an ADA.[103]\\nOn 2 February 2018, Satellogic, a high-resolution Earth observation imaging and analytics company, launched a ÑuSat type micro-satellite named in honor of Ada Lovelace.[104]\\n\\nCommemoration\\n Blue plaque to Lovelace in St. James\\'s Square, London\\nThe computer language Ada, created on behalf of the United States Department of Defense, was named after Lovelace.[105] The reference manual for the language was approved on 10\\xa0December 1980 and the Department of Defense Military Standard for the language, MIL-STD-1815, was given the number of the year of her birth.\\nIn 1981, the Association for Women in Computing inaugurated its Ada Lovelace Award.[106][107] Since 1998, the British Computer Society (BCS) has awarded the Lovelace Medal,[108] and in 2008 initiated an annual competition for women students.[109] BCSWomen sponsors the Lovelace Colloquium, an annual conference for women undergraduates.[109] Ada College is a further-education college in Tottenham Hale, London, focused on digital skills.[110]\\nAda Lovelace Day is an annual event celebrated on the second Tuesday of October,[111] which began in 2009.[112] Its goal is to \"...\\xa0raise the profile of women in science, technology, engineering, and maths,\" and to \"create new role models for girls and women\" in these fields. Events have included Wikipedia edit-a-thons with the aim of improving the representation of women on Wikipedia in terms of articles and editors to reduce unintended gender bias on Wikipedia. The Ada Initiative was a non-profit organisation dedicated to increasing the involvement of women in the free culture and open source movements.[113]\\nThe Engineering in Computer Science and Telecommunications College building in Zaragoza University is called the Ada Byron Building.[114] The computer centre in the village of Porlock, near where Lovelace lived, is named after her. Ada Lovelace House is a council-owned building in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, near where Lovelace spent her infancy; the building, which formerly housed the local district council offices, now provides high-quality office space for a number of local start-up businesses.[115][116]\\nShe is also the inspiration and influence for the Ada Developers Academy in Seattle, Washington. The academy is a non-profit that seeks to increase diversity in tech by training women, trans and non-binary people to be software engineers.[117]\\nIn 2018, The New York Times published a belated obituary for Ada Lovelace.[118]\\nOn 27 July 2018, Senator Ron Wyden submitted, in the United States Senate, the designation of 9 October 2018 as National Ada Lovelace Day: \"To honor the life and contributions of Ada Lovelace as a leading woman in science and mathematics\". The resolution (S.Res.592)[119] was considered, and agreed to without amendment and with a preamble by unanimous consent.\\n\\nBicentenary\\nThe bicentenary of Ada Lovelace\\'s birth was celebrated with a number of events, including:[120]\\n\\nThe Ada Lovelace Bicentenary Lectures on Computability, Israel Institute for Advanced Studies, 20\\xa0December 2015 – 31\\xa0January 2016.[121][122]\\nAda Lovelace Symposium, University of Oxford, 13–14 October 2015.[123]\\nAda.Ada.Ada, a one-woman show about the life and work of Ada Lovelace (using an LED dress), premiered at Edinburgh International Science Festival on 11 April 2015,[124] and continues to touring internationally to promote diversity on STEM at technology conferences,[125][126] businesses, government and educational organisations.[127][128]\\nSpecial exhibitions were displayed by the Science Museum in London, England[129] and the Weston Library[130] (part of the Bodleian Library) in Oxford, England.\\n\\nPublications\\nLovelace, Ada King.

For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. \\nTuring played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.[11][12] Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war,[13] but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14\\xa0million lives.[11]\\nAfter the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, which was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman\\'s Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers[14] and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis[1] and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.\\nTuring was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the Labouchere Amendment had mandated that \"gross indecency\" was a criminal offence in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES, as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.[15]\\nIn 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for \"the appalling way he was treated\". Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013.[16][17][18] The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.[19]\\n\\n.mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none}Contents\\n\\n1 Early life and education\\n\\n1.1 Family\\n1.2 School\\n1.3 Christopher Morcom\\n1.4 University and work on computability\\n\\n\\n2 Career and research\\n\\n2.1 Cryptanalysis\\n2.2 Bombe\\n2.3 Hut 8 and the naval Enigma\\n2.4 Turingery\\n2.5 Delilah\\n2.6 Early computers and the Turing test\\n2.7 Pattern formation and mathematical biology\\n\\n\\n3 Personal life\\n\\n3.1 Conviction for indecency\\n3.2 Death\\n3.3 Government apology and pardon\\n\\n\\n4 Awards, honours, and tributes\\n\\n4.1 Posthumous tributes\\n4.2 Centenary celebrations\\n4.3 Portrayal\\n\\n4.3.1 In theatre\\n4.3.2 In literature\\n4.3.3 In music\\n4.3.4 In film\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5 See also\\n6 References\\n\\n6.1 Sources\\n\\n\\n7 Further reading\\n\\n7.1 Articles\\n7.2 Books\\n\\n\\n8 External links\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly life and education[edit]\\nFamily[edit]\\nTuring was born in Maida Vale, London,[6] while his father, Julius Mathison Turing (1873–1947), was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service (ICS) at Chatrapur, then in the Madras Presidency and presently in Odisha state, in India.[20][21]  Turing\\'s father was the son of a clergyman, the Rev.\\xa0John Robert Turing, from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet. Turing\\'s mother, Julius\\' wife, was Ethel Sara Turing (née Stoney 1881–1976),[6] daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the Madras Railways. The Stoneys were a Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry family from both County Tipperary and County Longford, while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in County Clare.[22]\\nJulius\\' work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been  a general in the Bengal Army. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to Maida Vale,[23] London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth,[24][25] later the Colonnade Hotel.[20][26] Turing had an elder brother, John (the father of Sir John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the Turing baronets).[27]\\nTuring\\'s father\\'s civil service commission was still active and during Turing\\'s childhood years Turing\\'s parents travelled between Hastings in England[28] and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea, now marked with a blue plaque.[29] The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012, the centenary of Turing\\'s birth.[30]\\nVery early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently.[31] His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque.[32]\\n\\nSchool[edit]\\nTuring\\'s parents enrolled him at St Michael\\'s, a day school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-Sea, at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on, as did many of his subsequent teachers.\\nBetween January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex (now East Sussex).[33] In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School, a boarding independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike in Britain, but he was so determined to attend, that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles (97\\xa0km) from Southampton to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.[34]\\nTuring\\'s natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents: \"I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist, he is wasting his time at a public school\".[35] Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein\\'s work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein\\'s questioning of Newton\\'s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.[36]\\n\\nChristopher Morcom[edit]\\nAt Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom (1911 – 1930), who has been described as Turing\\'s \"first love\". Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing\\'s future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom\\'s death, in February 1930, from complications of bovine tuberculosis, contracted after drinking infected cow\\'s milk some years previously.[37][38][39]\\n\\nThe event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom\\'s mother Turing said:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me\\xa0... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive, because that is what he would like me to do.[40]\\n\\nTuring\\'s relationship with Morcom\\'s mother continued long after Morcom\\'s death, with her sending gifts to Turing, and him sending letters, typically on Morcom\\'s birthdays.[41] A day before the third anniversary of Morcom\\'s death (12 February, 1933), he wrote to Mrs. Morcom: I expect you will be thinking of Chris when this reaches you. I shall too, and this letter is just to tell you that I shall be thinking of Chris and of you tomorrow. I am sure that he is as happy now as he was when he was here. Your affectionate Alan.[42]\\n \\nSome have speculated that Morcom\\'s death was the cause of Turing\\'s atheism and materialism.[43] Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter, also written to Morcom\\'s mother, Turing said: Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body\\xa0... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a \\'spirit\\', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies, the \\'mechanism\\' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later, perhaps immediately.[44]\\n\\nUniversity and work on computability[edit]\\nAfter Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King\\'s College, Cambridge,[6] where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics. In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a fellow of King\\'s on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.[45] Unknown to the committee, the theorem had already been proven, in 1922, by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg.[46] A blue plaque at the college was unveiled on the centenary of his birth on 23 June 2012 and is now installed at the college\\'s Keynes Building on King\\'s Parade.[47][48]\\nIn 1936, Turing published his paper \"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\" (1936).[49] In this paper, Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel\\'s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel\\'s universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. The Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his \"universal computing machine\" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable: It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt.\\n\\n King\\'s College, Cambridge, where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him.\\nAlthough Turing\\'s proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church\\'s equivalent proof using his lambda calculus,[50] Turing\\'s approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church\\'s.[51] It also included a notion of a \\'Universal Machine\\' (now known as a universal Turing machine), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church\\'s lambda calculus). According to the Church–Turing thesis, Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing\\'s paper.[52] To this day, Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation.\\nFrom September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University,[4] in the second year as a Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.[53] In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton;[54] his dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals,[55][56] introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing, where Turing machines are augmented with so-called oracles, allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines. John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant, but he went back to England.[57]\\n\\nCareer and research[edit]\\nWhen Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics.[58] The lectures have been reconstructed verbatim, including interjections from Turing and other students, from students\\' notes.[59] Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed, with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths, but rather invents them.[60]\\n\\nCryptanalysis[edit]\\nDuring the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said, \"You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing\\'s was that genius.\"[61]\\nFrom September 1938, Turing had been working part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), the British codebreaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma with Dilly Knox, a senior GC&CS codebreaker.[62] Soon after the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Cipher Bureau had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of Enigma rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma code messages, Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem.[63] The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change, which they did in May 1940. Turing\\'s approach was more general, using crib-based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe (an improvement of the Polish Bomba).[64]\\n\\n Two cottages in the stable yard at Bletchley Park. Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940, before moving to Hut 8.\\nOn 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&CS.[65]\\nSpecifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were: deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy; developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus; developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40/42 (Tunny) dubbed Turingery and, towards the end of the war, the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah.\\n\\nBy using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process, Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches, titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography[66] and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions,[67] which were of such value to GC&CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012, shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician, \"who identified himself only as Richard,\" said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance, and their relevance to post-war cryptanalysis:[68] [He] said the fact that the contents had been restricted \"shows what a tremendous importance it has in the foundations of our subject\". ... The papers detailed using \"mathematical analysis to try and determine which are the more likely settings so that they can be tried as quickly as possible.\" ... Richard said that GCHQ had now \"squeezed the juice\" out of the two papers and was \"happy for them to be released into the public domain\".\\n\\nTuring had a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as \"Prof\" and his treatise on Enigma was known as the \"Prof\\'s Book\".[69] According to historian Ronald Lewin, Jack Good, a cryptanalyst who worked with Turing, said of his colleague:\\n\\nIn the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off. His bicycle had a fault: the chain would come off at regular intervals. Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand. Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen.[70]\\n\\nWhile working at Bletchley, Turing, who was a talented long-distance runner, occasionally ran the 40 miles (64\\xa0km) to London when he was needed for meetings,[71] and he was capable of world-class marathon standards.[72][73] Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team but he was hampered by an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards\\' Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He was Walton Athletic Club\\'s best runner, a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone.[74][75][76]\\nIn 1946, Turing was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by King George VI for his wartime services, but his work remained secret for many years.[77][78]\\n\\nBombe[edit]\\nMain article: Bombe\\nWithin weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park,[65] Turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the bombe, which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba kryptologiczna, from which its name was derived. The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman, became one of the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages.[79]\\n\\n A complete and working replica of a bombe now at The National Museum of Computing on Bletchley ParkThe bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message (i.e., rotor order, rotor settings and plugboard settings) using a suitable crib: a fragment of probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors (which had on the order of 1019 states, or 1022 states for the four-rotor U-boat variant),[80] the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented electromechanically.[citation needed]\\nThe bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter, which was impossible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.[81]\\nBy late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner-Barry were frustrated. Building on the work of the Poles, they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals, but their limited staff and bombes meant they could not translate all the signals. In the summer, they had considerable success, and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month; however, they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels, but had failed.[82]\\nOn 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill explaining their difficulties, with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces.[82] As Andrew Hodges, biographer of Turing, later wrote, \"This letter had an electric effect.\"[83] Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay, which read: \"ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done.\" On 18 November, the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken.[83] The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister\\'s response, but as Milner-Barry recalled, \"All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth.\"[84] More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war.[85]\\n\\n Statue of Turing by Stephen Kettle at Bletchley Park, commissioned by Sidney Frank, built from half a million pieces of Welsh slate.[86]\\nHut 8 and the naval Enigma[edit]\\nTuring decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma \"because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself\".[87] In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services.[87][88]\\nThat same night, he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus, a sequential statistical technique (what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis) to assist in breaking the naval Enigma, \"though I was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not, in fact, sure until some days had actually broken.\"[87] For this, he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the ban. Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors, substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes.[89] Later this sequential process of accumulating sufficient weight of evidence using decibans (one tenth of a ban) was used in Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher[90]\\nTuring travelled to the United States in November 1942[91] and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington; he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio.\\nTuring\\'s reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic:\\n\\nThe American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme, but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way.\\nTheir test (of commutators) can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it.[92]\\n\\n\\nDuring this trip, he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices.[93] He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence, Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8, although Alexander had been de facto head for some time (Turing having little interest in the day-to-day running of the section). Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.[94]\\nAlexander wrote of Turing\\'s contribution:\\n\\nThere should be no question in anyone\\'s mind that Turing\\'s work was the biggest factor in Hut 8\\'s success. In the early days, he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hut, but he also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief credit for the invention of the bombe. It is always difficult to say that anyone is \\'absolutely indispensable\\', but if anyone was indispensable to Hut 8, it was Turing. The pioneer\\'s work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the magnitude of Turing\\'s contribution was never fully realised by the outside world.[95]\\n\\nTuringery[edit]\\nIn July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed Turingery (or jokingly Turingismus)[96] for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans\\' new Geheimschreiber (secret writer) machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel-breaking, i.e., a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny\\'s wheels.[97] He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who, under the guidance of Max Newman, went on to build the Colossus computer, the world\\'s first programmable digital electronic computer, which replaced a simpler prior machine (the Heath Robinson), and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages.[98] Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher,[99][100] but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development.[101]\\n\\nDelilah[edit]\\nFollowing his work at Bell Labs in the US,[102] Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system. In the latter part of the war, he moved in order to work for the Secret Service\\'s Radio Security Service (later HMGCC) at Hanslope Park. At the park, he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah.[103] The machine was intended for different applications, but it lacked the capability for use with long-distance radio transmissions. In any case, Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully, with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech, Delilah was not adopted for use.[104] Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY, a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war.\\n\\nEarly computers and the Turing test[edit]\\n Plaque, 78 High Street, Hampton\\nBetween 1945 and 1947, Turing lived in Hampton, London,[105] while he worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a stored-program computer.[106] Von Neumann\\'s incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing\\'s paper, but it was much less detailed and, according to John R. Womersley, Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division, it \"contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing\\'s own\".[107] Although ACE was a feasible design, the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.[108] While he was at Cambridge, the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950, and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it, including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G-15. The full version of Turing\\'s ACE was not built until after his death.[109]\\nAccording to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics, published by Genscher, Düsseldorf, there was a meeting between Turing and Konrad Zuse.[110] It took place in Göttingen in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley, Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing (for more details see Herbert Bruderer, Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz).\\nIn 1948, Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. A year later, he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers—the Manchester Mark 1. Turing wrote the first version of the Programmer\\'s Manual for this machine, and was recruited by Ferranti as a consultant in the development of their commercialised machine, the Ferranti Mark 1. He continued to be paid consultancy fees by Ferranti until his death.[111] During this time, he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics,[112] and in \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" (Mind, October 1950), Turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence, and proposed an experiment that became known as the Turing test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called \"intelligent\". The idea was that a computer could be said to \"think\" if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being.[113] In the paper, Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind, it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child\\'s mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet; the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer.\\nIn 1948 Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, D.G. Champernowne, began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950, the program was completed and dubbed the Turbochamp.[114] In 1952, he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1, but lacking enough power, the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead, Turing \"ran\" the program by flipping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on a chessboard, taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded.[115]  According to Garry Kasparov, Turing\\'s program \"played a recognizable game of chess.\"[116] The program lost to Turing\\'s colleague Alick Glennie, although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne\\'s wife,\\nIsabel.[117]\\nHis Turing test was a significant, characteristically provocative, and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence, which continues after more than half a century.[118]\\n\\nPattern formation and mathematical biology[edit]\\nWhen Turing was 39 years old in 1951, he turned to mathematical biology, finally publishing his masterpiece \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\" in January 1952. He was interested in morphogenesis, the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. Among other things, he wanted to understand Fibonacci phyllotaxis, the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures.[119] He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space, termed a reaction-diffusion system, could account for \"the main phenomena of morphogenesis\".[120] He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example, if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place, and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A, then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic, and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A, but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates, then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. To calculate the extent of this, Turing would have needed a powerful computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951, so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand. These calculations gave the right qualitative results, and produced, for example, a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results, but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics. Belousov was not aware of Turing\\'s paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.[121]\\nAlthough published before the structure and role of DNA was understood, Turing\\'s work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology.[122] One of the early applications of Turing\\'s paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats, large and small.[123][124][125] Further research in the area suggests that Turing\\'s work can partially explain the growth of \"feathers, hair follicles, the branching pattern of lungs, and even the left-right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest.\"[126] In 2012, Sheth, et al. found that in mice, removal of Hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb, suggesting that Hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a Turing-type mechanism.[127] Later papers were not available until Collected Works of A.\\xa0M.\\xa0Turing was published in 1992.[128]\\n\\nPersonal life[edit]\\nIn 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly \"unfazed\" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.[129]\\n\\nConviction for indecency[edit]\\nIn January 1952, Turing was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Just before Christmas, Turing was walking along Manchester\\'s Oxford Road when he met Murray just outside the Regal Cinema and invited him to lunch. On 23 January, Turing\\'s house was burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time,[130] and both men were charged with \"gross indecency\" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885.[131] Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing\\'s solicitor \"reserved his defence\", i.e., did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations.\\nTuring was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, and he entered a plea of guilty.[132] The case, Regina v. Turing and Murray, was brought to trial on 31 March 1952.[133] Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation. His probation would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal physical changes designed to reduce libido. He accepted the option of injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES), a synthetic oestrogen; this feminization of his body was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused breast tissue to form,[134] fulfilling in the literal sense Turing\\'s prediction that \"no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I\\'ve not found out\".[135][136] Murray was given a conditional discharge.[137]\\nTuring\\'s conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC&CS in 1946, though he kept his academic job. He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other European countries. Turing was never accused of espionage but, in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park, he was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work.[138]\\n\\nDeath[edit]\\nOn 8 June 1954, Turing\\'s housekeeper found him dead; he had died the previous day. Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death.[139] When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,[140] it was speculated that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide. Andrew Hodges and another biographer, David Leavitt, have both speculated that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), his favourite fairy tale. Both men noted that (in Leavitt\\'s words) he took \"an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew.\"[141] Turing\\'s remains were cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954[142] and his ashes were scattered in the gardens of the crematorium, just as his father\\'s had been.[143]\\nPhilosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner\\'s historical verdict. He suggested an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing\\'s death: the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus used to electroplate gold onto spoons. The potassium cyanide was used to dissolve the gold. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland noted that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before going to bed, and it was not unusual for the apple to be discarded half-eaten.[144] In addition, Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment (which had been discontinued a year previously) \"with good humour\" and had shown no sign of despondency prior to his death. He even set down a list of tasks that he intended to complete upon returning to his office after the holiday weekend.[144] Turing\\'s mother believed that the ingestion was accidental, resulting from her son\\'s careless storage of laboratory chemicals.[145] Biographer Andrew Hodges theorised that Turing arranged the delivery of the equipment in order to deliberately allow his mother plausible deniability in regard to any suicide claims.[146]\\n\\n Turing\\'s OBE currently held in Sherborne School archives\\nConspiracy theorists pointed out that Turing was the cause of intense anxiety to the British authorities at the time of his death. The secret services feared that communists would entrap prominent homosexuals and use them to gather intelligence. Turing was still engaged in highly classified work when he was also a practising homosexual who holidayed in European countries near the Iron Curtain. It is possible that the secret services considered him too great a security risk and assassinated one of the most brilliant minds in their employ.[147]\\n\\nTuring believed in extrasensory perception,[148][149][clarification needed] and it has been suggested that his belief in fortune-telling may have caused his depressed mood. As a youth, Turing had been told by a gypsy fortune-teller that he would be a genius.[143] Shortly before his death, during a day-trip to St Annes-on Sea with the Greenbaum family,[when?] Turing again decided to consult a fortune-teller.[143] According to the Greenbaums\\' daughter, Barbara:But it was a lovely sunny day and Alan was in a cheerful mood and off we went... Then he thought it would be a good idea to go to the Pleasure Beach at Blackpool. We found a fortune-teller\\'s tent and Alan said he\\'d like to go in so we waited around for him to come back... And this sunny, cheerful visage had shrunk into a pale, shaking, horror-stricken face. Something had happened. We don\\'t know what the fortune-teller said but he obviously was deeply unhappy. I think that was probably the last time we saw him before we heard of his suicide.\"[150]\\nGovernment apology and pardon[edit]\\n\\nIn August 2009, British programmer John Graham-Cumming started a petition urging the British government to apologise for Turing\\'s prosecution as a homosexual.[151][152] The petition received more than 30,000 signatures.[153][154] The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, acknowledged the petition, releasing a statement on 10 September 2009 apologising and describing the treatment of Turing as \"appalling\":[153][155]\\n\\nThousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated. While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can\\'t put the clock back, his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him\\xa0... So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan\\'s work I am very proud to say: we\\'re sorry, you deserved so much better.[153][156]\\n\\nIn December 2011, William Jones created an e-petition[157] requesting that the British government pardon Turing for his conviction of \"gross indecency\":[158]\\n\\nWe ask the HM Government to grant a pardon to Alan Turing for the conviction of \"gross indecency\". In 1952, he was convicted of \"gross indecency\" with another man and was forced to undergo so-called \"organo-therapy\"—chemical castration. Two years later, he killed himself with cyanide, aged just 41. Alan Turing was driven to a terrible despair and early death by the nation he\\'d done so much to save. This remains a shame on the British government and British history. A pardon can go some way to healing this damage. It may act as an apology to many of the other gay men, not as well-known as Alan Turing, who were subjected to these laws.[157]\\n\\nThe petition gathered over 37,000 signatures,[18][157] and was supported by Manchester MP John Leech but the request was discouraged by Justice Minister Lord McNally, who said:[159]\\n\\nA posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as Alan Turing was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence. He would have known that his offence was against the law and that he would be prosecuted. It is tragic that Alan Turing was convicted of an offence that now seems both cruel and absurd—particularly poignant given his outstanding contribution to the war effort. However, the law at the time required a prosecution and, as such, long-standing policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and, rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right, ensure instead that we never again return to those times.[160]\\n\\nJohn Leech, the MP for Manchester Withington (2005–15), submitted several bills to Parliament[161] and campaigned with Jones to secure the pardon. Leech made the case in the House of Commons that Turing\\'s contribution to the war made him a national hero and that it was \"ultimately just embarrassing\" that the conviction still stood.[162] Leech continued to take the bill through Parliament and campaigned for several years until it was passed.[163]\\nAt the UK premiere of a film based on Turing\\'s life, The Imitation Game, the producers thanked Leech for bringing the topic to public attention and securing Turing\\'s pardon.[164] His campaign turned to acquiring pardons for the 75,000 other men convicted of the same crime. Leech\\'s campaign gained public support from leading scientists, including Stephen Hawking.[165]\\nOn 26 July 2012, a bill was introduced in the House of Lords to grant a statutory pardon to Turing for offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, of which he was convicted on 31 March 1952.[166] Late in the year in a letter to The Daily Telegraph, the physicist Stephen Hawking and 10 other signatories including the Astronomer Royal Lord Rees, President of the Royal Society Sir Paul Nurse, Lady Trumpington (who worked for Turing during the war) and Lord Sharkey (the bill\\'s sponsor) called on Prime Minister David Cameron to act on the pardon request.[167] The government indicated it would support the bill,[168][169][170] and it passed its third reading in the Lords in October.[171]\\nAt the bill\\'s second reading in the House of Commons on 29 November 2013, Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to the bill, delaying its passage. The bill was due to return to the House of Commons on 28 February 2014,[172] but before the bill could be debated in the House of Commons,[173] the government elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy. On 24 December 2013, Queen Elizabeth II signed a pardon for Turing\\'s conviction for \"gross indecency\", with immediate effect.[17] Announcing the pardon, Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling said Turing deserved to be \"remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort\" and not for his later criminal conviction.[16][18] The Queen officially pronounced Turing pardoned in August 2014.[174] The Queen\\'s action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the Second World War.[175] Pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent, and a request has been made by the family or other interested party; neither condition was met in regard to Turing\\'s conviction.[176]\\nIn a letter to the Prime Minister, David Cameron, human rights advocate Peter Tatchell criticised the decision to single out Turing due to his fame and achievements when thousands of others convicted under the same law have not received pardons.[177] Tatchell also called for a new investigation into Turing\\'s death:\\n\\nA new inquiry is long overdue, even if only to dispel any doubts about the true cause of his death—including speculation that he was murdered by the security services (or others). I think murder by state agents is unlikely. There is no known evidence pointing to any such act. However, it is a major failing that this possibility has never been considered or investigated.[178]\\n\\nIn September 2016, the government announced its intention to expand this retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical indecency offences, in what was described as an \"Alan Turing law\".[179][180] The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for the law in the United Kingdom, contained in the Policing and Crime Act 2017, which serves as an amnesty law to retroactively pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. The law applies in England and Wales.[181]\\n\\nAwards, honours, and tributes[edit]\\n The Alan Turing Building at the University of Manchester in 2008\\nTuring was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire 1946.[78] He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1951.[7] Several things are named in his honour:\\n\\n\\nAlan Turing Institute\\nChurch–Turing thesis\\nGood–Turing frequency estimation\\nTuring completeness\\nTuring degree\\nTuring fixed-point combinator\\nTuring Institute\\nTuring Lecture\\nTuring machine\\nTuring patterns\\nTuring reduction\\nTuring switch\\nTuring test\\n\\nPosthumous tributes[edit]\\nVarious institutions have paid tribute to Turing by naming things after him including:\\n\\n\\nThe computer room at King\\'s College, Cambridge, Turing\\'s alma mater, is called the Turing Room.[182]\\nThe Turing Room at the University of Edinburgh\\'s School of Informatics houses a bust of Turing by Eduardo Paolozzi, and a set (No. 42/50) of his Turing prints (2000).[183]\\nThe University of Surrey has a statue of Turing on their main piazza[184] and one of the buildings of Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences is named after him.[185]\\nIstanbul Bilgi University organises an annual conference on the theory of computation called \"Turing Days\".[186]\\nThe University of Texas at Austin has an honours computer science programme named the Turing Scholars.[187]\\nIn the early 1960s, Stanford University named the sole lecture room of the Polya Hall Mathematics building \"Alan Turing Auditorium\".[188]\\nOne of the amphitheatres of the Computer Science department (LIFL[189]) at the University of Lille in northern France is named in honour of Alan M.

It is widely considered to be the computing world\\'s highest honour, equivalent to the Nobel Prize.[206]\\n\\nOn 23 June 1998, on what would have been Turing\\'s 86th birthday, his biographer, Andrew Hodges, unveiled an official English Heritage blue plaque at his birthplace in Warrington Crescent, London, later the Colonnade Hotel.[207][208] To mark the 50th anniversary of his death, a memorial plaque was unveiled on 7 June 2004 at his former residence, Hollymeade, in Wilmslow, Cheshire.[209] A blue plaque marking Turing\\'s home at Wilmslow, Cheshire\\nOn 13 March 2000, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines issued a set of postage stamps to celebrate the greatest achievements of the 20th century, one of which carries a portrait of Turing against a background of repeated 0s and 1s, and is captioned: \"1937: Alan Turing\\'s theory of digital computing\". On 1 April 2003, Turing\\'s work at Bletchley Park was named an IEEE Milestone.[210] On 28 October 2004, a bronze statue of Turing sculpted by John W. Mills was unveiled at the University of Surrey in Guildford, marking the 50th anniversary of Turing\\'s death; it portrays him carrying his books across the campus.[184]\\nTuring was one of four mathematicians examined in the BBC documentary entitled Dangerous Knowledge (2008).[211] The Princeton Alumni Weekly named Turing the second most significant alumnus in the history of Princeton University, second only to President James Madison. A 1.5-ton, life-size statue of Turing was unveiled on 19 June 2007 at Bletchley Park. Built from approximately half a million pieces of Welsh slate, it was sculpted by Stephen Kettle, having been commissioned by the American billionaire Sidney Frank.[212]\\nTuring has been honoured in various ways in Manchester, the city where he worked towards the end of his life. In 1994, a stretch of the A6010 road (the Manchester city intermediate ring road) was named \"Alan Turing Way\". A bridge carrying this road was widened, and carries the name Alan Turing Bridge. A statue of Turing was unveiled in Manchester on 23 June 2001 in Sackville Park, between the University of Manchester building on Whitworth Street and Canal Street. The memorial statue depicts the \"father of computer science\" sitting on a bench at a central position in the park. Turing is shown holding an apple. The cast bronze bench carries in relief the text \\'Alan Mathison Turing 1912–1954\\', and the motto \\'Founder of Computer Science\\' as it could appear if encoded by an Enigma machine: \\'IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ\\'. However, the meaning of the coded message is disputed, as the \\'u\\' in \\'computer\\' matches up with the \\'u\\' in \\'ADXUO\\'. As a letter encoded by an enigma machine can not appear as itself, the actual message behind the code is uncertain.[213]\\n\\n Turing memorial statue plaque in Sackville Park, Manchester\\nA plaque at the statue\\'s feet reads \\'Father of computer science, mathematician, logician, wartime codebreaker, victim of prejudice\\'. There is also a Bertrand Russell quotation: \"Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture.\" The sculptor buried his own old Amstrad computer under the plinth as a tribute to \"the godfather of all modern computers\".[214]\\nIn 1999, Time magazine named Turing as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century and stated, \"The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine.\"[8]\\nIn 2002, Turing was ranked twenty-first on the BBC\\'s poll of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote.[215] In 2006, British writer and mathematician Ioan James chose Turing as one of twenty people to feature in his book about famous historical figures who may have had some of the traits of Asperger syndrome.[216] In 2010, actor/playwright Jade Esteban Estrada portrayed Turing in the solo musical, Icons: The Lesbian and Gay History of the World, Vol. 4. In 2011, in The Guardian\\'s \"My hero\" series, writer Alan Garner chose Turing as his hero and described how they had met while out jogging in the early 1950s. Garner remembered Turing as \"funny and witty\" and said that he \"talked endlessly\".[217] In 2006, Turing was named with online resources as an LGBT History Month Icon.[218] In 2006, Boston Pride named Turing their Honorary Grand Marshal.[219]\\n\\n Turing memorial statue in Sackville Park, Manchester\\nThe logo of Apple Inc. is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to Turing, with the bite mark a reference to his death.[220] Both the designer of the logo[221] and the company deny that there is any homage to Turing in the design.[222][223] Stephen Fry has recounted asking Steve Jobs whether the design was intentional, saying that Jobs\\' response was, \"God, we wish it were.\"[224] In February 2011, Turing\\'s papers from the Second World War were bought for the nation with an 11th-hour bid by the National Heritage Memorial Fund, allowing them to stay at Bletchley Park.[225]\\nIn 2012, Turing was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display that celebrates LGBT history and people.[226][227]\\nThe song \"Alan et la Pomme\", by francophone singer-songwriter Salvatore Adamo, is a tribute to Turing.[228] Turing\\'s life and work featured in a BBC children\\'s programme about famous scientists, Absolute Genius with Dick and Dom, first broadcast on 12 March 2014.\\nOn 17 May 2014, the world\\'s first work of public art to recognise Turing as gay was commissioned in Bletchley, close by to Bletchley Park where his war-time work was carried out.

The story concentrates on the period of Turing’s life where he breaks the Enigma code with other codebreakers in Bletchley Park.[263][264][265][266] It received the academy award for best adapted screenplay in 2015. It was a tremendous success, bringing in $233.6 million[267] for a production cost of $14 million[268].\\nSee also[edit]\\n\\nList of things named after Alan Turing\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ a b Alan Turing publications indexed by Google Scholar \\n\\n^ a b Alan Turing at the Mathematics Genealogy Project\\n\\n^ Gandy, Robin Oliver (1953).

Turing\\'s mother, who survived him by many years, wrote this 157-page biography of her son, glorifying his life. It was published in 1959, and so could not cover his war work. Scarcely 300 copies were sold (Sara Turing to Lyn Newman, 1967, Library of St John\\'s College, Cambridge). The six-page foreword by Lyn Irvine includes reminiscences and is more frequently quoted. It was re-published by Cambridge University Press in 2012, to honour the centenary of his birth, and included a new foreword by Martin Davis, as well as a never-before-published memoir by Turing\\'s older brother John F.

He was a child prodigy who was educated by his father, a tax collector in Rouen. Pascal\\'s earliest work was in the natural and applied sciences where he made important contributions to the study of fluids, and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalising the work of Evangelista Torricelli. Pascal also wrote in defence of the scientific method.\\nIn 1642, while still a teenager, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines. After three years of effort and 50 prototypes,[4] he built 20 finished machines (called Pascal\\'s calculators and later Pascalines) over the following 10 years,[5] establishing him as one of the first two inventors of the mechanical calculator.[6][7]\\nPascal was an important mathematician, helping create two major new areas of research: he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of 16, and later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory, strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science. Following Galileo Galilei and Torricelli, in 1647, he rebutted Aristotle\\'s followers who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum. Pascal\\'s results caused many disputes before being accepted.\\nIn 1646, he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within Catholicism known by its detractors as Jansenism.[8] Following a religious experience in late 1654, he began writing influential works on philosophy and theology. His two most famous works date from this period: the Lettres provinciales and the Pensées, the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and Jesuits. In that year, he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle. Between 1658 and 1659, he wrote on the cycloid and its use in calculating the volume of solids.\\nThroughout his life, Pascal was in frail health, especially after the age of 18; he died just two months after his 39th birthday.[9]\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Early life and education\\n2 Contributions to mathematics\\n\\n2.1 Philosophy of mathematics\\n\\n\\n3 Contributions to the physical sciences\\n4 Adult life, religion, philosophy, and literature\\n\\n4.1 Religious conversion\\n4.2 Brush with death\\n4.3 The Provincial Letters\\n4.4 The Pensées\\n4.5 Last works and death\\n\\n\\n5 Legacy\\n6 Works\\n7 See also\\n8 References\\n9 Further reading\\n10 External links\\n\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

He lost his mother, Antoinette Begon, at the age of three.[10] His father, Étienne Pascal (1588–1651), who also had an interest in science and mathematics, was a local judge and member of the \"Noblesse de Robe\". Pascal had two sisters, the younger Jacqueline and the elder Gilberte.\\nIn 1631, five years after the death of his wife,[2] Étienne Pascal moved with his children to Paris. The newly arrived family soon hired Louise Delfault, a maid who eventually became an instrumental member of the family. Étienne, who never remarried, decided that he alone would educate his children, for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability, particularly his son Blaise. The young Pascal showed an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science.\\n\\n Portrait of Pascal\\nParticularly of interest to Pascal was a work of Desargues on conic sections. Following Desargues\\' thinking, the 16-year-old Pascal produced, as a means of proof, a short treatise on what was called the \"Mystic Hexagram\", Essai pour les coniques (\"Essay on Conics\") and sent it—his first serious work of mathematics—to Père Mersenne in Paris; it is known still today as Pascal\\'s theorem. It states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle (or conic) then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line (called the Pascal line).\\nPascal\\'s work was so precocious that Descartes was convinced that Pascal\\'s father had written it. When assured by Mersenne that it was, indeed, the product of the son and not the father, Descartes dismissed it with a sniff: \"I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients,\" adding, \"but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a 16-year-old child.\"[11]\\nIn France at that time offices and positions could be—and were—bought and sold. In 1631, Étienne sold his position as second president of the Cour des Aides for 65,665 livres.[12] The money was invested in a government bond which provided, if not a lavish, then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the Pascal family to move to, and enjoy, Paris. But in 1638 Richelieu, desperate for money to carry on the Thirty Years\\' War, defaulted on the government\\'s bonds. Suddenly Étienne Pascal\\'s worth had dropped from nearly 66,000 livres to less than 7,300.\\n\\n An early Pascaline on display at the Musée des Arts et Métiers, Paris\\nLike so many others, Étienne was eventually forced to flee Paris because of his opposition to the fiscal policies of Cardinal Richelieu, leaving his three children in the care of his neighbour Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children\\'s play with Richelieu in attendance that Étienne was pardoned. In time, Étienne was back in good graces with the cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the king\\'s commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouen—a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.\\nIn 1642, in an effort to ease his father\\'s endless, exhausting calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid (into which work the young Pascal had been recruited), Pascal, not yet 19, constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called Pascal\\'s calculator or the Pascaline. Of the eight Pascalines known to have survived, four are held by the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris and one more by the Zwinger museum in Dresden, Germany, exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators.[13] Although these machines are pioneering forerunners to a further 400 years of development of mechanical methods of calculation, and in a sense to the later field of computer engineering, the calculator failed to be a great commercial success. Partly because it was still quite cumbersome to use in practice, but probably primarily because it was extraordinarily expensive, the Pascaline became little more than a toy, and a status symbol, for the very rich both in France and elsewhere in Europe. Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade, and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design.\\n\\nContributions to mathematics\\n Pascal\\'s triangle. Each number is the sum of the two directly above it. The triangle demonstrates many mathematical properties in addition to showing binomial coefficients.\\nPascal continued to influence mathematics throughout his life. His Traité du triangle arithmétique (\"Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle\") of 1653 described a convenient tabular presentation for binomial coefficients, now called Pascal\\'s triangle. The triangle can also be represented:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n\\n\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n1\\n3\\n6\\n10\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n1\\n4\\n10\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n1\\n5\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n1\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe defines the numbers in the triangle by recursion: Call the number in the (m\\xa0+\\xa01)th row and (n\\xa0+\\xa01)th column tmn. Then tmn\\xa0=\\xa0tm–1,n\\xa0+\\xa0tm,n–1, for m\\xa0=\\xa00,\\xa01,\\xa02,\\xa0... and n\\xa0=\\xa00,\\xa01,\\xa02,\\xa0...

From this discussion, the notion of expected value was introduced. Pascal later (in the Pensées) used a probabilistic argument, Pascal\\'s Wager, to justify belief in God and a virtuous life. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for Leibniz\\' formulation of the calculus.[16]\\nAfter a religious experience in 1654, Pascal mostly gave up work in mathematics.\\n\\nPhilosophy of mathematics\\nPascal\\'s major contribution to the philosophy of mathematics came with his De l\\'Esprit géométrique (\"Of the Geometrical Spirit\"), originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous \"Petites-Ecoles de Port-Royal\" (\"Little Schools of Port-Royal\"). The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths. At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up—first principles, therefore, cannot be reached. Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true.\\nPascal also used De l\\'Esprit géométrique to develop a theory of definition. He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent. The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of essentialism. Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics, arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of formalism as formulated by Descartes.\\nIn De l\\'Art de persuader (\"On the Art of Persuasion\"), Pascal looked deeper into geometry\\'s axiomatic method, specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the axioms upon which later conclusions are based. Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths.\\n\\nContributions to the physical sciences\\n An illustration of the (apocryphal) Pascal\\'s barrel experiment\\nPascal\\'s work in the fields of the study of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the hydraulic press (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the syringe. He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as Pascal\\'s barrel experiment.\\nBy 1647, Pascal had learned of Evangelista Torricelli\\'s experimentation with barometers. Having replicated an experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube. At the time, most scientists contended that, rather than a vacuum, some invisible matter was present. This was based on the Aristotelian notion that creation was a thing of substance, whether visible or invisible; and that this substance was forever in motion. Furthermore, \"Everything that is in motion must be moved by something,\" Aristotle declared.[17] Therefore, to the Aristotelian trained scientists of Pascal\\'s time, a vacuum was an impossibility. How so? As proof it was pointed out:\\n\\nLight passed through the so-called \"vacuum\" in the glass tube.\\nAristotle wrote how everything moved, and must be moved by something.\\nTherefore, since there had to be an invisible \"something\" to move the light through the glass tube, there was no vacuum in the tube. Not in the glass tube or anywhere else. Vacuums – the absence of any and everything – were simply an impossibility.\\nFollowing more experimentation in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide (\"New experiments with the vacuum\"), which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube. This work was followed by Récit de la grande expérience de l\\'équilibre des liqueurs (\"Account of the great experiment on equilibrium in liquids\") published in 1648.\\nThe Torricellian vacuum found that air pressure is equal to the weight of 30 inches of mercury. If air has a finite weight, Earth\\'s atmosphere must have a maximum height. Pascal reasoned that if true, air pressure on a high mountain must be less than at a lower altitude. He lived near the Puy de Dôme mountain, 4,790 feet (1,460\\xa0m) tall, but his health was poor so could not climb it.[18] On 19 September 1648, after many months of Pascal\\'s friendly but insistent prodding, Florin Périer, husband of Pascal\\'s elder sister Gilberte, was finally able to carry out the fact-finding mission vital to Pascal\\'s theory. The account, written by Périer, reads:\\n\\n.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}The weather was chancy last Saturday...[but] around five o\\'clock that morning...the Puy-de-Dôme was visible...so I decided to give it a try. Several important people of the city of Clermont had asked me to let them know when I would make the ascent...I was delighted to have them with me in this great work...\\n...at eight o\\'clock we met in the gardens of the Minim Fathers, which has the lowest elevation in town....First I poured 16 pounds of quicksilver...into a vessel...then took several glass tubes...each four feet long and hermetically sealed at one end and opened at the other...then placed them in the vessel [of quicksilver]...I found the quick silver stood at 26\" and 3\\u200b1⁄2 lines above the quicksilver in the vessel...I repeated the experiment two more times while standing in the same spot...[they] produced the same result each time...\\nI attached one of the tubes to the vessel and marked the height of the quicksilver and...asked Father Chastin, one of the Minim Brothers...to watch if any changes should occur through the day...Taking the other tube and a portion of the quick silver...I walked to the top of Puy-de-Dôme, about 500 fathoms higher than the monastery, where upon experiment...found that the quicksilver reached a height of only 23\" and 2 lines...I repeated the experiment five times with care...each at different points on the summit...found the same height of quicksilver...in each case...[19]\\n\\n\\nPascal replicated the experiment in Paris by carrying a barometer up to the top of the bell tower at the church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, a height of about 50 metres. The mercury dropped two lines.\\nIn the face of criticism that some invisible matter must exist in Pascal\\'s empty space, Pascal, in his reply to Estienne Noel, gave one of the 17th century\\'s major statements on the scientific method, which is a striking anticipation of the idea popularised by Karl Popper that scientific theories are characterised by their falsifiability: \"In order to show that a hypothesis is evident, it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it; instead, if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena, that suffices to establish its falsity.\"[20] His insistence on the existence of the vacuum also led to conflict with other prominent scientists, including Descartes.\\nPascal introduced a primitive form of roulette and the roulette wheel in his search for a perpetual motion machine.[21]\\n\\nAdult life, religion, philosophy, and literature\\nPart of a series onCatholic philosophyAquinas, Scotus, and Ockham\\nEthics\\nNatural law\\nPersonalism\\nSocial teaching\\nVirtue ethics\\n\\nSchools\\nAugustinianism\\nMolinism\\nOccamism\\nSalamanca\\nScholasticism\\nNeo-scholasticism\\nScotism\\nThomism\\n\\nPhilosophers\\nAntiquity\\nAmbrose\\nAthanasius the Great\\nAugustine of Hippo\\nCyprian of Carthage\\nGregory of Nyssa\\nIgnatius of Antioch\\nIrenaeus of Lyons\\nJerome\\nJohn Chrysostom\\nJohn of Damascus\\nJustin Martyr\\nOrigen\\nPaul the Apostle\\nTertullian\\n\\n\\nMedieval\\nBoethius\\nIsidore of Seville\\nScotus Eriugena\\nBede\\nAnselm of Canterbury\\nHildegard of Bingen\\nPeter Abelard\\nBernard of Clairvaux\\nHugh of Saint Victor\\nThomas Aquinas\\nBenedict of Nursia\\nPope Gregory I\\nPeter Lombard\\nBonaventure\\nAlbertus Magnus\\nDuns Scotus\\nRoger Bacon\\nGiles of Rome\\nJames of Viterbo\\nGregory of Rimini\\nWilliam of Ockham\\nCatherine of Siena\\nPaul of Venice\\n\\n\\nRenaissance and Modern\\nBaltasar Gracián\\nNicholas of Cusa\\nLuis de Molina\\nTeresa of Ávila\\nThomas More\\nFrancis de Sales\\nFrancisco de Vitoria\\nDomingo de Soto\\nMartín de Azpilcueta\\nTomás de Mercado\\nPope Benedict XIV\\nAntoine Arnauld\\nRobert Bellarmine\\nRené Descartes\\nFrançois Fénelon\\nPierre Gassendi\\nAlphonsus Liguori\\nNicolas Malebranche\\nBlaise Pascal\\nFrancisco Suarez\\nGiovanni Botero\\n\\n\\nContemporary\\nPope Benedict XVI\\nPope John Paul II\\nMortimer J.

A nothing in relation to infinity, all in relation to nothing, a central point between nothing and all and infinitely far from understanding either. The ends of things and their beginnings are impregnably concealed from him in an impenetrable secret. He is equally incapable of seeing the nothingness out of which he was drawn and the infinite in which he is engulfed.\\n\\nBlaise Pascal, Pensées No. 72\\nReligious conversion\\n Pascal studying the cycloid, by Augustin Pajou, 1785, Louvre\\nIn the winter of 1646, Pascal\\'s 58-year-old father broke his hip when he slipped and fell on an icy street of Rouen; given the man\\'s age and the state of medicine in the 17th century, a broken hip could be a very serious condition, perhaps even fatal. Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France: Monsieur Doctor Deslandes and Monsieur Doctor de La Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal \"would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice, for the old man survived and was able to walk again...\"[22] But treatment and rehabilitation took three months, during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes had become regular visitors.\\nBoth men were followers of Jean Guillebert, proponent of a splinter group from Catholic teaching known as Jansenism. This still fairly small sect was making surprising inroads into the French Catholic community at that time. It espoused rigorous Augustinism. Blaise spoke with the doctors frequently, and after their successful treatment of his father, borrowed from them works by Jansenist authors. In this period, Pascal experienced a sort of \"first conversion\" and began to write on theological subjects in the course of the following year.\\nPascal fell away from this initial religious engagement and experienced a few years of what some biographers have called his \"worldly period\" (1648–54). His father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to Pascal and his sister Jacqueline, for whom Pascal acted as conservator. Jacqueline announced that she would soon become a postulant in the Jansenist convent of Port-Royal. Pascal was deeply affected and very sad, not because of her choice, but because of his chronic poor health; he needed her just as she had needed him.\\n\\nSuddenly there was war in the Pascal household. Blaise pleaded with Jacqueline not to leave, but she was adamant. He commanded her to stay, but that didn\\'t work, either. At the heart of this was...Blaise\\'s fear of abandonment...if Jacqueline entered Port-Royal, she would have to leave her inheritance behind...[but] nothing would change her mind.[23]\\n\\nBy the end of October in 1651, a truce had been reached between brother and sister. In return for a healthy annual stipend, Jacqueline signed over her part of the inheritance to her brother.  Gilberte had already been given her inheritance in the form of a dowry. In early January, Jacqueline left for Port-Royal. On that day, according to Gilberte concerning her brother, \"He retired very sadly to his rooms without seeing Jacqueline, who was waiting in the little parlor...\"[24]\\nIn early June 1653, after what must have seemed like endless badgering from Jacqueline,\\nPascal formally signed over the whole of his sister\\'s inheritance to Port-Royal, which, to him, \"had begun to smell like a cult.\"[25] With two thirds of his father\\'s estate now gone, the 29-year-old Pascal was now consigned to genteel poverty.\\nFor a while, Pascal pursued the life of a bachelor. During visits to his sister at Port-Royal in 1654, he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God.[26]\\n\\nBrush with death\\nOn 23 November 1654, between 10:30 and 12:30 at night, Pascal had an intense religious vision and immediately recorded the experience in a brief note to himself which began: \"Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and the scholars...\" and concluded by quoting Psalm 119:16: \"I will not forget thy word. Amen.\" He seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death.[27] This piece is now known as the Memorial. The story of the carriage accident[clarification needed] as having led to the experience described in the Memorial is disputed by some scholars.[28]\\nHis belief and religious commitment revitalized, Pascal visited the older of two convents at Port-Royal for a two-week retreat in January 1655. For the next four years, he regularly travelled between Port-Royal and Paris. It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion, the Provincial Letters.\\n\\nThe Provincial Letters\\nMain article: Lettres provinciales\\n\\nFrench literature\\nby category\\n\\nFrench literary history\\nMedieval\\nRenaissance\\n17th\\n18th\\n19th\\n20th century\\nContemporary\\n\\nFrench writers\\nChronological list\\nWriters by category\\nEssayists\\nNovelists\\nPlaywrights\\nPoets\\nShort story writers\\nChildren\\'s writers\\n\\nPortals\\nFrance\\nFrench language\\nLiterature\\nFrench/Francophone literature\\nvte\\nBeginning in 1656–57, Pascal published his memorable attack on casuistry, a popular ethical method used by Catholic thinkers in the early modern period (especially the Jesuits, and in particular Antonio Escobar). Pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of sins. The 18-letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte and incensed Louis XIV. The king ordered that the book be shredded and burnt in 1660. In 1661, in the midsts of the formulary controversy, the Jansenist school at Port-Royal was condemned and closed down; those involved with the school had to sign a 1656 papal bull condemning the teachings of Jansen as heretical. The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied Alexander VII himself. Even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal\\'s arguments.\\nAside from their religious influence, the Provincial Letters were popular as a literary work. Pascal\\'s use of humor, mockery, and vicious satire in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption, and influenced the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\\nCharles Perrault wrote of the Letters: \"Everything is there—purity of language, nobility of thought, solidity in reasoning, finesse in raillery, and throughout an agrément not to be found anywhere else.\"[29]\\n\\nThe Pensées\\nMain article: Pensées\\nPascal\\'s most influential theological work, referred to posthumously as the Pensées (\"Thoughts\"), was not completed before his death. It was to have been a sustained and coherent examination and defense of the Christian faith, with the original title Apologie de la religion Chrétienne (\"Defense of the Christian Religion\"). The first version of the numerous scraps of paper found after his death appeared in print as a book in 1669 titled Pensées de M. Pascal sur la religion, et sur quelques autres sujets (\"Thoughts of M. Pascal on religion, and on some other subjects\") and soon thereafter became a classic. One of the Apologie\\'s main strategies was to use the contradictory philosophies of skepticism and stoicism, personalized by Montaigne on one hand, and Epictetus on the other, in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God.\\nPascal\\'s Pensées is widely considered to be a masterpiece, and a landmark in French prose. When commenting on one particular section (Thought #72), Sainte-Beuve praised it as the finest pages in the French language.[30] Will Durant hailed the Pensées as \"the most eloquent book in French prose\".[31]\\n\\nLast works and death\\n Pascal\\'s epitaph in Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, where he was buried\\nT. S. Eliot described him during this phase of his life as \"a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic among men of the world.\" Pascal\\'s ascetic lifestyle derived from a belief that it was natural and necessary for a person to suffer. In 1659, Pascal fell seriously ill. During his last years, he frequently tried to reject the ministrations of his doctors, saying, \"Sickness is the natural state of Christians.\"[32]\\nLouis XIV suppressed the Jansenist movement at Port-Royal in 1661. In response, Pascal wrote one of his final works, Écrit sur la signature du formulaire (\"Writ on the Signing of the Form\"), exhorting the Jansenists not to give in. Later that year, his sister Jacqueline died, which convinced Pascal to cease his polemics on Jansenism. Pascal\\'s last major achievement, returning to his mechanical genius, was inaugurating perhaps the first bus line, the carrosses à cinq sols, moving passengers within Paris in a carriage with many seats.\\nIn 1662, Pascal\\'s illness became more violent, and his emotional condition had severely worsened since his sister\\'s death. Aware that his health was fading quickly, he sought a move to the hospital for incurable diseases, but his doctors declared that he was too unstable to be carried. In Paris on 18 August 1662, Pascal went into convulsions and received extreme unction. He died the next morning, his last words being \"May God never abandon me,\" and was buried in the cemetery of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont.[32]\\nAn autopsy performed after his death revealed grave problems with his stomach and other organs of his abdomen, along with damage to his brain. Despite the autopsy, the cause of his poor health was never precisely determined, though speculation focuses on tuberculosis, stomach cancer, or a combination of the two.[33] The headaches which afflicted Pascal are generally attributed to his brain lesion.\\n\\nLegacy\\n Death mask of Blaise Pascal.\\nIn honour of his scientific contributions, the name Pascal has been given to the SI unit of pressure, to a programming language, and Pascal\\'s law (an important principle of hydrostatics), and as mentioned above, Pascal\\'s triangle and Pascal\\'s wager still bear his name.\\nPascal\\'s development of probability theory was his most influential contribution to mathematics. Originally applied to gambling, today it is extremely important in economics, especially in actuarial science. John Ross writes, \"Probability theory and the discoveries following it changed the way we regard uncertainty, risk, decision-making, and an individual\\'s and society\\'s ability to influence the course of future events.\"[34] However, it should be noted that Pascal and Fermat, though doing important early work in probability theory, did not develop the field very far. Christiaan Huygens, learning of the subject from the correspondence of Pascal and Fermat, wrote the first book on the subject. Later figures who continued the development of the theory include Abraham de Moivre and Pierre-Simon Laplace.\\nIn literature, Pascal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the French Classical Period and is read today as one of the greatest masters of French prose. His use of satire and wit influenced later polemicists. The content of his literary work is best remembered for its strong opposition to the rationalism of René Descartes and simultaneous assertion that the main countervailing philosophy, empiricism, was also insufficient for determining major truths.\\nIn France, prestigious annual awards, Blaise Pascal Chairs are given to outstanding international scientists to conduct their research in the Ile de France region.[35] One of the Universities of Clermont-Ferrand, France – Université Blaise Pascal – is named after him. The University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, holds an annual math contest named in his honour.[36]\\nPascalian theology has grown out of his perspective that we are, according to Wood, \"born into a duplicitous world that shapes us into duplicitous subjects and so we find it easy to reject God continually and deceive ourselves about our own sinfulness\".[37]\\nRoberto Rossellini directed a filmed biopic, Blaise Pascal, which originally aired on Italian television in 1971.[38] Pascal was a subject of the first edition of the 1984 BBC Two documentary, Sea of Faith, presented by Don Cupitt.\\nIn 2014, Nvidia announced its new Pascal microarchitecture, which is named for Pascal. The first graphics cards featuring Pascal were released in 2016.\\nThe 2017 game Nier: Automata has multiple characters named after famous philosophers; one of these is a sentient pacifistic machine named Pascal, who serves as a major supporting character. Pascal creates a village for machines to live peacefully with the androids they\\'re at war with and acts as a parental figure for other machines trying to adapt to their newly-found individuality.\\n\\nWorks\\nEssai pour les coniques [Essay on conics] (1639)\\nExperiences nouvelles touchant le vide [New experiments with the vacuum] (1647)\\nRécit de la grande expérience de l\\'équilibre des liqueurs [Account of the great experiment on equilibrium in liquids] (1648)\\nTraité du triangle arithmétique [Treatise on the arithmetic triangle] (1653)\\nLettres provinciales [The provincial letters] (1656–57)\\nDe l\\'Esprit géométrique [On the geometrical spirit] (1657 or 1658)\\nÉcrit sur la signature du formulaire (1661)\\nTraité du triangle arithmétique (Treatise on arithmetical triangle) (written c. 1654;[39] publ. 1665)\\nPensées [Thoughts] (incomplete at death; publ. 1670)\\nSee also\\n\\nScientific revolution\\nList of pioneers in computer science\\nList of works by Eugène Guillaume\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n^ Vincent Jullien (ed.), Seventeenth-Century Indivisibles Revisited, Birkhäuser, 2015, p. 188.\\n\\n^ a b O\\'Connor, J.J.; Robertson, E.F.

Although the judges only had 2,500 words on their list, Donald found 4,500 words, winning the contest. As prizes, the school received a new television and enough candy bars for all of his schoolmates to eat.[6][5]\\n\\nEducation[edit]\\nIn 1956, Knuth received\\xa0a scholarship\\xa0to the Case Institute of Technology (now part of Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland, Ohio. He also joined Beta Nu Chapter of the Theta Chi fraternity. While studying physics at the Case Institute of Technology, Knuth was introduced to the IBM 650, one of the early mainframes. After reading the computer\\'s manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school, because he believed he could do it better.[7]\\nIn 1958, Knuth created a program to help his school\\'s basketball team win their games. He assigned \"values\" to players in order to gauge their probability of getting points, a novel approach that Newsweek and CBS Evening News later reported on.[7]\\nKnuth was one of the founding editors of Case Institute\\'s Engineering and Science Review, which won a national award as best technical magazine in 1959.[8] He then switched from physics to mathematics, and in 1960 he received his bachelor of science degree, simultaneously being given a master of science degree by a special award of the faculty who considered his work exceptionally outstanding.[7][9]\\nIn 1963, with mathematician Marshall Hall as his adviser,[2] he earned a PhD in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology.[10]\\n\\nEarly work[edit]\\nAfter receiving his PhD, Knuth joined Caltech\\'s faculty as an assistant professor.[11]\\nHe accepted a commission to write a book on computer programming language compilers. While working on this project, Knuth decided that he could not adequately treat the topic without first developing a fundamental theory of computer programming, which became The Art of Computer Programming. He originally planned to publish this as a single book. As Knuth developed his outline for the book, he concluded that he required six volumes, and then seven, to thoroughly cover the subject. He published the first volume in 1968.[12]\\nJust before publishing the first volume of The Art of Computer Programming, Knuth left Caltech to accept employment with the Institute for Defense Analyses\\' Communications Research Division, then situated on the Princeton University campus, which was performing mathematical research in cryptography to support the National Security Agency.\\nKnuth then left this position[when?] to join the Stanford University faculty, where he is now Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer Science, Emeritus.[13][14]\\n\\nWritings[edit]\\nKnuth is a writer, as well as a computer scientist.[11] Knuth has been called the \"father of the analysis of algorithms\".[15]\\n\\nThe Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP)[edit]\\nMain article: The Art of Computer Programming\\nIn the 1970s, Knuth described computer science as \"a totally new field with no real identity. And the standard of available publications was not that high. A lot of the papers coming out were quite simply wrong.\\xa0... So one of my motivations was to put straight a story that had been very badly told.\"[16] By 2011, the first three volumes and part one of volume four of his series had been published.[17] Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science 2nd ed., which originated with an expansion of the mathematical preliminaries section of Volume 1 of TAoCP, has also been published.\\nBill Gates has praised the difficulty of the subject matter in The Art of Computer Programming, stating, \"If you think you\\'re a really good programmer\\xa0... You should definitely send me a résumé if you can read the whole thing.\"[18]\\n\\nOther works[edit]\\nKnuth is also the author of Surreal Numbers,[19] a mathematical novelette on John Conway\\'s set theory construction of an alternate system of numbers. Instead of simply explaining the subject, the book seeks to show the development of the mathematics. Knuth wanted the book to prepare students for doing original, creative research.\\nIn 1995, Knuth wrote the foreword to the book A=B by Marko Petkovšek, Herbert Wilf and Doron Zeilberger.[20] Knuth is also an occasional contributor of language puzzles to Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics.\\nKnuth has also delved into recreational mathematics.  He contributed articles to the Journal of Recreational Mathematics beginning in the 1960s, and was acknowledged as a major contributor in Joseph Madachy\\'s Mathematics on Vacation.[21]\\nKnuth has also appeared in a number of Numberphile[22] and Computerphile videos on YouTube where he has discussed topics from writing Surreal Numbers to why he doesn\\'t use email.\\n\\nWorks regarding Knuth\\'s religious beliefs[edit]\\nIn addition to his writings on computer science, Knuth, a Lutheran,[23] is also the author of 3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated,[24] in which he examines the Bible by a process of systematic sampling, namely an analysis of chapter 3, verse 16 of each book.  Each verse is accompanied by a rendering in calligraphic art, contributed by a group of calligraphers under the leadership of Hermann Zapf. Subsequently, he was invited to give a set of lectures on his 3:16 project, resulting in another book, Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About, where he published the lectures \"God and Computer Science\".\\n\\nOpinion on software patents[edit]\\nAs a member of the academic and scientific community, Knuth is strongly opposed to the policy of granting software patents for trivial solutions that should be obvious, but has expressed more nuanced views for nontrivial solutions such as the interior-point method of linear programming.[25] He has expressed his disagreement directly to both the United States Patent and Trademark Office and European Patent Organisation.[26]\\n\\nComputer Musings[edit]\\nKnuth gives informal lectures a few times a year at Stanford University, which he titled \"Computer Musings\". He was a visiting professor at the Oxford University Department of Computer Science in the United Kingdom until 2017 and an Honorary Fellow of Magdalen College.[27][28]\\n\\nProgramming[edit]\\nDigital typesetting[edit]\\nIn the 1970s the publishers of TAOCP abandoned Monotype in favor of phototypesetting. Knuth became so frustrated with the inability of the latter system to approach the quality of the previous volumes, typeset using the older system, that he took time out to work on digital typesetting and created TeX and Metafont.[29]\\n\\nLiterate programming[edit]\\nWhile developing TeX, Knuth created a new methodology of programming, which he called literate programming, because he believed that programmers should think of programs as works of literature. \"Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.\"[30]\\nKnuth embodied the idea of literate programming in the WEB system. The same WEB source is used to weave a TeX file, and to tangle a Pascal source file. These in their turn produce a readable description of the program and an executable binary respectively. A later iteration of the system, CWEB, replaces Pascal with C.\\nKnuth used WEB to program TeX and METAFONT, and published both programs as books.\\n\\nPersonal life[edit]\\nDonald Knuth married Nancy Jill Carter on 24 June 1961, while he was a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology. They have two children: John Martin Knuth and Jennifer Sierra Knuth.[31]\\n\\nChinese name[edit]\\nKnuth\\'s Chinese name is Gao Dena (simplified Chinese: 高德纳; traditional Chinese: 高德納; pinyin: Gāo dé nà).[32][3] In 1977, he was given this name by Frances Yao, shortly before making a 3-week trip to China.[3][33] In his 1980 volume of The Art of Computer Programming (simplified Chinese: 计算机程序设计艺术; traditional Chinese: 電腦程式設計藝術; pinyin: Jìsuànjī chéngxù shèjì yìshù), Knuth explains that he embraced his Chinese name because he wanted to be known by the growing numbers of computer programmers in China at the time. In 1989, his Chinese name was placed atop the Journal of Computer Science and Technology\\'s header, which Knuth says \"makes me feel close to all Chinese people although I cannot speak your language\".[33]\\n\\nHealth concerns[edit]\\nIn 2006, Knuth was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He underwent surgery in December that year and stated, \"a little bit of radiation therapy\\xa0... as a precaution but the prognosis looks pretty good\", as he reported in his video autobiography.[34]\\n\\nHumor[edit]\\n One of Knuth\\'s reward checks\\n \"Nested parens\"—Donald Knuth (on Jacob Appelbaum\\'s shirt within the two parentheses), Jacob Appelbaum, and Donald Knuth\\nKnuth used to pay a finder\\'s fee of $2.56 for any typographical errors or mistakes discovered in his books, because \"256 pennies is one hexadecimal dollar\", and $0.32 for \"valuable suggestions\". According to an article in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\'s Technology Review, these Knuth reward checks are \"among computerdom\\'s most prized trophies\". Knuth had to stop sending real checks in 2008 due to bank fraud, and instead now gives each error finder a \"certificate of deposit\" from a publicly listed balance in his fictitious \"Bank of San Serriffe\".[35]\\nHe once warned a correspondent, \"Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.\"[36]\\nKnuth published his first \"scientific\" article in a school magazine in 1957 under the title \"The Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures\". In it, he defined the fundamental unit of length as the thickness of Mad No. 26, and named the fundamental unit of force \"whatmeworry\". Mad published the article in issue No. 33 (June 1957).[37][38]\\nTo demonstrate the concept of recursion, Knuth intentionally referred \"Circular definition\" and \"Definition, circular\" to each other in the index of The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1.\\n\\nThe preface of Concrete Mathematics has the following paragraph:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}When DEK taught Concrete Mathematics at Stanford for the first time, he explained the somewhat strange title by saying that it was his attempt to teach a math course that was hard instead of soft.  He announced that, contrary to the expectations of his colleagues, he was not going to teach the Theory of Aggregates, nor Stone\\'s Embedding Theorem, nor even the Stone–Čech compactification. (Several students from the civil engineering department got up and quietly left the room.)\\n\\nAt the TUG 2010 Conference, Knuth announced a satirical XML-based successor to TeX, titled \"iTeX\" (pronounced\\xa0[iː˨˩˦tɛks˧˥], performed with a bell ringing), which would support features such as arbitrarily scaled irrational units, 3D printing, input from seismographs and heart monitors, animation, and stereophonic sound.[39][40][41]\\n\\nAwards and honors[edit]\\nIn 1971, Knuth was the recipient of the first ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award. He has received various other awards including the Turing Award, the National Medal of Science, the John von Neumann Medal, and the Kyoto Prize.\\nKnuth was elected a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society (DFBCS) in 1980 in recognition of Knuth\\'s contributions to the field of computer science.\\nIn 1990 he was awarded the one-of-a-kind academic title of Professor of The Art of Computer Programming, which has since been revised to Professor Emeritus of The Art of Computer Programming.\\nKnuth was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1975. In 1992, he became an associate of the French Academy of Sciences. Also that year, he retired from regular research and teaching at Stanford University in order to finish The Art of Computer Programming. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2003.[1]\\nKnuth was elected as a Fellow (first class of Fellows) of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in 2009 for his outstanding contributions to mathematics.[42] He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.[43] In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[44] Other awards and honors include:\\n\\n\\nFirst ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award, 1971\\nTuring Award, 1974\\nLester R.

She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.\\nPrior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College. Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II but was rejected because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by Howard H. Aiken. In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer.  At Eckert–Mauchly she began developing the compiler. She believed that a programming language based on English was possible.  Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written for the A-0 System.[2][3][4][5] During her wartime service, she co-authored three papers based on her work on the Harvard Mark 1.\\nIn 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the COBOL language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967 the Navy recalled her to active duty.  She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the Digital Equipment Corporation, sharing her computing experiences.\\nOwing to her accomplishments and her naval rank, she was sometimes referred to as \"Amazing Grace\".[6][7] The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS\\xa0Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 \"Hopper\" supercomputer at NERSC.[8] During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. A college at Yale University was renamed in her honor.  In 1991, she received the National Medal of Technology. On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.[9]\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Early life and education\\n2 Career\\n\\n2.1 World War II\\n2.2 UNIVAC\\n2.3 COBOL\\n2.4 Standards\\n\\n\\n3 Retirement\\n4 Post-retirement\\n5 Anecdotes\\n6 Death\\n7 Dates of rank\\n8 Awards and honors\\n\\n8.1 Military awards\\n8.2 Other awards\\n\\n\\n9 Legacy\\n\\n9.1 Places\\n9.2 Programs\\n9.3 In popular culture\\n\\n9.3.1 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10 Obituary notices\\n11 See also\\n12 References\\n13 Further reading\\n14 External links\\n\\n\\nEarly life and education[edit]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrace Hopper (As Told By U.S. Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith)\\n\\n\\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\\nHopper was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children. Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of Scottish and Dutch descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church.[10] Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War.[10]:2–3\\nGrace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock).[11] For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey. Hopper was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (her test scores in Latin were too low), but she was admitted the following year.  She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor\\'s degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master\\'s degree at Yale University in 1930.\\nIn 1934, she earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale[12] under the direction of Øystein Ore.[13][14] Her dissertation, \"New Types of Irreducibility Criteria\", was published that same year.[15] Hopper began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in 1941.[16]\\nShe was married to New York University professor Vincent Foster Hopper (1906–1976) from 1930 until their divorce in 1945.[13][17] She did not marry again, but chose to retain his surname.\\n\\nCareer[edit]\\nWorld War II[edit]\\n Hopper\\'s signatures on a duty officer signup sheet for the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard, which built and operated the Mark I\\nHopper had tried to enlist in the Navy early in World War II. She was rejected for a few reasons. At age 34, she was too old to enlist, and her weight to height ratio was too low. She was also denied on the basis that her job as a mathematician and mathematics professor at Vassar College was valuable to the war effort.[18] During the war in 1943, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve; she was one of many women who volunteered to serve in the WAVES. She had to get an exemption to enlist; she was 15 pounds (6.8\\xa0kg) below the Navy minimum weight of 120 pounds (54\\xa0kg). She reported in December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen\\'s School at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade. She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken. Hopper and Aiken co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Hopper\\'s request to transfer to the regular Navy at the end of the war was declined due to her advanced age of 38. She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve. Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at Vassar in favor of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard.[19]\\n\\n Hopper in a computer room in Washington, D.C., 1978, photographed by Lynn Gilbert\\nUNIVAC[edit]\\nIn 1949, Hopper became an employee of the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation as a senior mathematician and joined the team developing the UNIVAC I.[16]  Hopper also served as UNIVAC director of Automatic Programming Development for Remington Rand. The UNIVAC was the first known large-scale electronic computer to be on the market in 1950,  and was more competitive at processing information than the Mark I.[20]\\nWhen Hopper recommended the development of a new programming language that would use entirely English words, she \"was told very quickly that [she] couldn\\'t do this because computers didn\\'t understand English.\" Her idea was not accepted for 3 years, and she published her first paper on the subject, compilers, in 1952. In the early 1950s, the company was taken over by the Remington Rand corporation, and it was while she was working for them that her original compiler work was done.  The program was known as the A compiler and its first version was A-0.[21]:11\\nIn 1952, she had an operational link-loader, which at the time was referred to as a compiler. She later said that \"Nobody believed that,\" and that she \"had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic.\"[22] She goes on to say that her compiler \"translated mathematical notation into machine code. Manipulating symbols was fine for mathematicians but it was no good for data processors who were not symbol manipulators. Very few people are really symbol manipulators. If they are they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. It\\'s much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say \"Subtract income tax from pay\" instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols. COBOL is the major language used today in data processing.\"[23]\\nIn 1954 Hopper was named the company\\'s first director of automatic programming, and her department released some of the first compiler-based programming languages, including MATH-MATIC and FLOW-MATIC.[16]\\n\\nCOBOL[edit]\\n Hopper at the UNIVAC I console, c. 1960\\nIn the spring of 1959, computer experts from industry and government were brought together in a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL). Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language COBOL (an acronym for COmmon Business-Oriented Language). The new language extended Hopper\\'s FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent, COMTRAN.  Hopper\\'s belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to English (rather than in machine code or in languages close to machine code, such as assembly languages) was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date.[24] Among the members of the committee that worked on COBOL was Mount Holyoke College alumnus Jean E. Sammet.[25]\\nFrom 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navy\\'s Office of Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1973.[19] She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy.[19]\\n\\nStandards[edit]\\nIn the 1970s, Hopper advocated for the Defense Department to replace large, centralized systems with networks of small, distributed computers. Any user on any computer node could access common databases located on the network.[21]:119 She developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and components, most significantly for early programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL. The Navy tests for conformance to these standards led to significant convergence among the programming language dialects of the major computer vendors. In the 1980s, these tests (and their official administration) were assumed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), known today as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\\n\\nRetirement[edit]\\n Hopper being promoted to the rank of commodore in 1983\\nIn accordance with Navy attrition regulations, Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank of commander at age 60 at the end of 1966.[26]  She was recalled to active duty in August 1967 for a six-month period that turned into an indefinite assignment.  She again retired in 1971 but was again asked to return to active duty in 1972. She was promoted to captain in 1973 by Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr.[27]\\nAfter Republican Representative Philip Crane saw her on a March 1983 segment of 60 Minutes, he championed H.J.Res. 341, a joint resolution originating in the House of Representatives, which led to her promotion on 15 December 1983 to commodore by special Presidential appointment by President Ronald Reagan.[27][28][29][30] She remained on active duty for several years beyond mandatory retirement by special approval of Congress.[31]  Effective November 8, 1985, the rank of commodore was renamed rear admiral (lower half) and Hopper became one of the Navy\\'s few female admirals.\\nFollowing a career that spanned more than 42 years, Admiral Hopper took retirement from the Navy on August 14, 1986.[32] At a celebration held in Boston on the USS\\xa0Constitution to commemorate her retirement, Hopper was awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the highest non-combat decoration awarded by the Department of Defense.[33]\\nAt the time of her retirement, she was the oldest active-duty commissioned officer in the United States Navy (79 years, eight months and five days), and had her retirement ceremony aboard the oldest commissioned ship in the United States Navy (188 years, nine months and 23 days).[34]  (Admirals William D. Leahy, Chester W. Nimitz, Hyman G. Rickover and Charles Stewart were the only other officers in the Navy\\'s history to serve on active duty at a higher age.  Leahy and Nimitz served on active duty for life due to their promotions to the rank of fleet admiral.)\\n\\nPost-retirement[edit]\\nFollowing her retirement from the Navy, she was hired as a senior consultant to Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Hopper was initially offered the job position by Rita Yavinsky, but she insisted on applying for the position at DEC, and going through the typical formal interview process. She also sent a letter to Yavinsky\\'s boss explaining that she would be available on alternating Thursdays, receiving a high salary, and have access to an unlimited expense account if she were to be exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer. After the proposal from Hopper, she was hired as a full-time senior consultant. As part of her position, she would report to Yavinsky. In this position, Hopper represented the company at industry forums, serving on various industry committees, along with other obligations.[10] She retained that position until her death at age 85 in 1992.\\nHopper was a goodwill ambassador in her primary activity in this capacity. She lectured widely about the early days of computing, her career, and on efforts that computer vendors could take to make life easier for their users. She visited most of Digital\\'s engineering facilities, where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks. Although no longer a serving officer, she always wore her Navy full dress uniform to these lectures (which is not allowed under U.S. Department of Defense regulation 32 CFR 53.2(a)(2)).\\n\"The most important thing I\\'ve accomplished, other than building the compiler,\" she said, \"is training young people.\" They come to me, you know, and say, \\'Do you think we can do this?\\' I say, \\'Try it.\\' And I back \\'em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir \\'em up at intervals so they don\\'t forget to take chances.\"[35]\\n\\nAnecdotes[edit]\\n Photo of \"first computer bug\" (a moth)\\nThroughout much of her later career, Hopper was much in demand as a speaker at various computer-related events. She was well known for her lively and irreverent speaking style, as well as a rich treasury of early war stories. She also received the nickname \"Grandma COBOL\".[36]\\nWhile she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University in 1947,[37] her associates discovered a moth that was stuck in a relay; the moth impeded the operation of the relay. While neither Hopper nor her crew mentioned the phrase \"debugging\" in their logs, the case was held as an instance of literal \"debugging.\" For many years, the term bug had been in use in engineering.[38][39] The remains of the moth can be found in the group\\'s log book at the Smithsonian Institution\\'s National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.[37]\\nGrace Hopper is famous for her nanoseconds visual aid. People (such as generals and admirals) used to ask her why satellite communication took so long.  She started handing out pieces of wire that were just under one foot long (11.8 inches (30\\xa0cm))—the distance that light travels in one nanosecond. She gave these pieces of wire the metonym \"nanoseconds.\"[30]  She was careful to tell her audience that the length of her nanoseconds was actually the maximum speed the signals would travel in a vacuum, and that signals would travel more slowly through the actual wires that were her teaching aids. Later she used the same pieces of wire to illustrate why computers had to be small to be fast. At many of her talks and visits, she handed out \"nanoseconds\" to everyone in the audience, contrasting them with a coil of wire 984 feet (300 meters) long,[40] representing a microsecond. Later, while giving these lectures while working for DEC, she passed out packets of pepper, calling the individual grains of ground pepper picoseconds.[41]\\nJay Elliot described Grace Hopper as appearing to be \"\\'all Navy\\', but when you reach inside, you find a \\'Pirate\\' dying to be released\".[42]\\nDeath[edit]\\nOn New Year\\'s Day 1992, Hopper died in her sleep of natural causes at her home in Arlington, Virginia;[43] she was 85 years of age. She was interred with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery.[44]\\n\\nDates of rank[edit]\\nEnsign – December 1943[45]\\nLieutenant (junior grade) – June 27, 1944[46][10]\\nLieutenant – January 1, 1946[45]\\nLieutenant Commander – April 1, 1952\\nCommander – July 1, 1957\\nRetired – December 31, 1966[10]\\nRecalled to active duty – August 1967[10]\\nRetired – 1971[10]\\nRecalled to active duty – 1972[19]\\nCaptain – August 2, 1973[47]\\nCommodore – December 15, 1983[10]\\nRear Admiral (Lower Half) – November 8, 1985[10]\\nFinal retirement – August 31, 1986[10]\\nAwards and honors[edit]\\nMilitary awards[edit]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTop Row\\n\\nDefense Distinguished Service Medal(1986)\\n\\nLegion of Merit(1967)\\n\\nMeritorious Service Medal(1980)\\n\\n\\n2nd Row\\n\\nPresidential Medal of Freedom(2016, Posthumous)\\n\\nAmerican Campaign Medal(1944)\\n\\nWorld War II Victory Medal(1945)\\n\\n\\nBottom Row\\n\\nNational Defense Service Medal with bronze service star(1953, 1966)\\n\\nArmed Forces Reserve Medalwith two bronze hourglass devices(1963, 1973, 1983)\\n\\nNaval Reserve Medal(1953)\\n\\n\\nOther awards[edit]\\n1964: Hopper was awarded the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award, the Society\\'s highest honor, \"In recognition of her significant contributions to the burgeoning computer industry as an engineering manager and originator of automatic programming systems.\"[48]\\n1969: Hopper was awarded the inaugural Data Processing Management Association Man of the Year award (now called the Distinguished Information Sciences Award).[49]\\n1971: The annual Grace Murray Hopper Award for Outstanding Young Computer Professionals was established in 1971 by the Association for Computing Machinery.[50]\\n1973: First American and the first woman of any nationality to be made a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society.[51]\\n1982: American Association of University Women Achievement Award and an Honorary Doctor of Science from Marquette University.[52]\\n1985: Honorary Doctor of Letters from Western New England College (now Western New England University).[53][54]\\n1986: Upon her retirement, she received the Defense Distinguished Service Medal.\\n1986: Honorary Doctor of Science  from Syracuse University.[55]\\n1987: The first Computer History Museum Fellow Award Recipient \"for contributions to the development of programming languages, for standardization efforts, and for lifelong naval service.\"[56]\\n1988: Golden Gavel Award, Toastmasters International.[57]\\n1991: National Medal of Technology.[45]\\n1991: Elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[58]\\n1994: Inducted into the National Women\\'s Hall of Fame.[59]\\n1996: USS\\xa0Hopper\\xa0(DDG-70) was launched.[50] Nicknamed Amazing Grace, it is on a very short list of U.S. military vessels named after women.\\n2001: Eavan Boland wrote a poem dedicated to Grace Hopper titled \"Code\" in her 2001 release Against Love Poetry.[60]\\n2001: The Gracies, the Government Technology Leadership Award were named in her honor.[61]\\n2009: The Department of Energy\\'s National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center named its flagship system \"Hopper\".[62]\\n2009: Office of Naval Intelligence creates the Grace Hopper Information Services Center.[63]\\n2013: Google made the Google Doodle for Hopper\\'s 107th birthday an animation of her sitting at a computer, using COBOL to print out her age.

Thanks to this machine and its predecessors, Zuse has often been regarded as the inventor of the modern computer.[2][3][4][5][6][7]\\nZuse was also noted for the S2 computing machine, considered the first process control computer. He founded one of the earliest computer businesses in 1941, producing the Z4, which became the world\\'s first commercial computer. From 1943[8] to 1945[9] he designed the first high-level programming language, Plankalkül.[10] In 1969, Zuse suggested the concept of a computation-based universe in his book Rechnender Raum (Calculating Space).\\nMuch of his early work was financed by his family and commerce, but after 1939 he was given resources by the Nazi German government.[11] Due to World War II, Zuse\\'s work went largely unnoticed in the United Kingdom and the United States. Possibly his first documented influence on a US company was IBM\\'s option on his patents in 1946.\\nThere is a replica of the Z3, as well as the original Z4, in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. The Deutsches Technikmuseum in Berlin has an exhibition devoted to Zuse, displaying twelve of his machines, including a replica of the Z1 and several of Zuse\\'s paintings.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Pre-World War II work and the Z1\\n2 Z2, Z3, and Z4\\n3 S1 and S2\\n4 Plankalkül\\n5 Graphomat Z64 plotter\\n6 Helix tower\\n7 Personal life\\n8 Death\\n9 Zuse the entrepreneur\\n10 Calculating Space\\n11 Awards and honours\\n12 Zuse Year 2010\\n13 See also\\n14 References\\n15 Sources\\n16 Further reading\\n17 External links\\n\\n\\nPre-World War II work and the Z1\\n Zuse Z1 replica in the German Museum of Technology in Berlin\\nBorn in Berlin on 22 June 1910, he moved with his family in 1912 to East Prussian Braunsberg (now Braniewo in Poland), where his father was a postal clerk. Zuse attended the Collegium Hosianum in Braunsberg. In 1923, the family moved to Hoyerswerda, where he passed his Abitur in 1928, qualifying him to enter university.\\nHe enrolled in the Technische Hochschule Berlin (now Technical University of Berlin) and explored both engineering and architecture, but found them boring. Zuse then pursued civil engineering, graduating in 1935. For a time, he worked for the Ford Motor Company, using his considerable artistic skills in the design of advertisements.[10] He started work as a design engineer at the Henschel aircraft factory in Schönefeld near Berlin. This required the performance of many routine calculations by hand, which he found mind-numbingly boring, leading him to dream of doing them by machine.\\nBeginning in 1935 he experimented in the construction of computers in his parents\\' flat on Wrangelstraße 38, moving with them into their new flat on Methfesselstraße 10, the street leading up the Kreuzberg, Berlin.[12] Working in his parents\\' apartment in 1936, he produced his first attempt, the Z1, a floating point binary mechanical calculator with limited programmability, reading instructions from a perforated 35\\xa0mm film.[10] In 1937, Zuse submitted two patents that anticipated a von Neumann architecture. He finished the Z1 in 1938. The Z1 contained some 30,000 metal parts and never worked well due to insufficient mechanical precision. On 30 January 1944, the Z1 and its original blueprints were destroyed with his parents\\' flat and many neighbouring buildings by a British air raid in World War II.[13]\\nBetween 1987 and 1989, Zuse recreated the Z1, suffering a heart attack midway through the project. It cost 800,000\\xa0DM, (approximately $500,000) and required four individuals (including Zuse) to assemble it. Funding for this retrocomputing project was provided by Siemens and a consortium of five companies.\\n\\nZ2, Z3, and Z4\\n Plaque commemorating Zuse\\'s work, attached to the ruin of Methfesselstraße 7, Berlin Zuse completed his work entirely independently of other leading computer scientists and mathematicians of his day. Between 1936 and 1945, he was in near-total intellectual isolation.[14] In 1939, Zuse was called to military service, where he was given the resources to ultimately build the Z2.[11] In September 1940 Zuse presented the Z2, covering several rooms in the parental flat, to experts of the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt (DVL; i.e. German Research Institute for Aviation).[15] The Z2 was a revised version of the Z1 using telephone relays.\\nThe DVL granted research subsidies so that in 1941 Zuse started a company, Zuse Apparatebau (Zuse Apparatus Construction), to manufacture his machines,[16] renting a workshop on the opposite side in Methfesselstraße 7 and stretching through the block to Belle-Alliance Straße 29 (renamed and renumbered as Mehringdamm 84 in 1947).[12][17]\\nImproving on the basic Z2 machine, he built the Z3 in 1941. On 12 May 1941 Zuse presented the Z3, built in his workshop, to the public.[17][18] The Z3 was a binary 22-bit floating point calculator featuring programmability with loops but without conditional jumps, with memory and a calculation unit based on telephone relays. The telephone relays used in his machines were largely collected from discarded stock. Despite the absence of conditional jumps, the Z3 was a Turing complete computer. However, Turing-completeness was never considered by Zuse (who had practical applications in mind) and only demonstrated in 1998 (see History of computing hardware).\\nThe Z3, the first fully operational electromechanical computer, was partially financed by German government-supported DVL, which wanted their extensive calculations automated. A request by his co-worker Helmut Schreyer—who had helped Zuse build the Z3 prototype in 1938[19]—for government funding for an electronic successor to the Z3 was denied as \"strategically unimportant\".\\n\\n Statue of Zuse in Bad Hersfeld In 1937, Schreyer had advised Zuse to use vacuum tubes as switching elements; Zuse at this time considered it a crazy idea (\"Schnapsidee\" in his own words). Zuse\\'s workshop on Methfesselstraße 7 (with the Z3) was destroyed in an Allied Air raid in late 1943 and the parental flat with Z1 and Z2 on 30 January the following year, whereas the successor Z4, which Zuse had begun constructing in 1942[20] in new premises in the Industriehof on Oranienstraße 6, remained intact.[21] On 3 February 1945, aerial bombing caused devastating destruction in the Luisenstadt, the area around Oranienstraße, including neighbouring houses.[22] This event effectively brought Zuse\\'s research and development to a complete halt. The partially finished, relay-based Z4 was packed and moved from Berlin on 14 February, only arriving in Göttingen two weeks later.[21]\\nWork on the Z4 could not be resumed immediately in the extreme privation of post-war Germany, and it was not until 1949 that he was able to resume work on it. He showed it to the mathematician Eduard Stiefel of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zürich) who ordered one in 1950. On 8 November 1949, Zuse KG was founded. The Z4 was delivered to ETH Zurich on 12 July 1950, and proved very reliable.[10]\\n\\nS1 and S2\\nIn 1940, the German government began funding him through the Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt (AVA, Aerodynamic Research Institute, forerunner of the DLR),[23] which used his work for the production of glide bombs. Zuse built the S1 and S2 computing machines, which were special purpose devices which computed aerodynamic corrections to the wings of radio-controlled flying bombs. The S2 featured an integrated analog-to-digital converter under program control, making it the first process-controlled computer.[20]\\nThese machines contributed to the Henschel Werke Hs 293 and Hs 294 guided missiles developed by the German military between 1941 and 1945, which were the precursors to the modern cruise missile.[20][24][25] The circuit design of the S1 was the predecessor of Zuse\\'s Z11.[20] Zuse believed that these machines had been captured by occupying Soviet troops in 1945.[20]\\n\\nPlankalkül\\nMain article: Plankalkül\\nWhile working on his Z4 computer, Zuse realised that programming in machine code was too complicated. He started working on a PhD thesis[26] containing groundbreaking research years ahead of its time, mainly the first high-level programming language, Plankalkül (\"Plan Calculus\") and, as an elaborate example program, the first real computer chess engine.[27] After the 1945 Luisenstadt bombing, he flew from Berlin for the rural Allgäu, and, unable to do any hardware development, he continued working on the Plankalkül, eventually publishing some brief excerpts of his thesis in 1948 and 1959; the work in its entirety, however, remained unpublished until 1972.[27] The PhD thesis was submitted at University of Augsburg, but rejected for formal reasons, because Zuse forgot to pay the 400 Mark university enrollment fee. (The rejection did not bother him.[28]) Plankalkül slightly influenced the design of ALGOL 58[29] but was itself implemented only in 1975 in a dissertation by Joachim Hohmann.[30] Heinz Rutishauser, one of the inventors of ALGOL, wrote: \"The very first attempt to devise an algorithmic language was undertaken in 1948 by K. Zuse. His notation was quite general, but the proposal never attained the consideration it deserved\". Further implementations followed in 1998 and then in 2000 by a team from the Free University of Berlin. Donald Knuth suggested a thought experiment: What might have happened had the bombing not taken place, and had the PhD thesis accordingly been published as planned?[27]\\n\\nGraphomat Z64 plotter\\n Z64 Graphomat plotter\\nIn addition to his computing-related work, described above, Zuse began to work in 1956 on a high precision, large format plotter. It was demonstrated at the 1961 Hanover Fair,[31] and became well known also outside of the technical world thanks to Frieder Nake\\'s pioneering computer art work.[32]\\nOther plotters designed by Zuse include the ZUSE Z90 and ZUSE Z9004.[31]\\n\\nHelix tower\\nIn the last years of his life, Zuse conceptualized and created a purely mechanical, extensible, modular tower automaton he named \"helix tower\" (\"Helixturm\"). The structure is based on a gear drive that employs rotary motion (e.g. provided by a crank) to assemble modular components from a storage space, elevating a tube-shaped tower; the process is reversible, and inverting the input direction will deconstruct the tower and store the components. The Deutsches Museum restored Zuse\\'s original 1:30 functional model that can be extended to a height of 2.7 m.[33] Zuse intended the full construction to reach a height of 120 m, and envisioned it for use with wind power generators and radio transmission installations.[34]\\n\\nPersonal life\\n Zuse Memorial in Hünfeld, Hessen\\nKonrad Zuse married Gisela Brandes in January 1945, employing a carriage, himself dressed in tailcoat and top hat and with Gisela in a wedding veil, for Zuse attached importance to a \"noble ceremony\". Their son Horst, the first of five children, was born in November 1945.\\nWhile Zuse never became a member of the Nazi Party, he is not known to have expressed any doubts or qualms about working for the Nazi war effort. Much later, he suggested that in modern times, the best scientists and engineers usually have to choose between either doing their work for more or less questionable business and military interests in a Faustian bargain, or not pursuing their line of work at all.[35]\\nAccording to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics, published by Genscher, Düsseldorf, there was a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse.[36] It took place in Göttingen in 1947. The encounter had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley, Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing. (For more details see Herbert Bruderer, Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz).\\nAfter he retired, he focused on his hobby of painting.[citation needed]\\nZuse was an atheist.[37][38]\\n\\nDeath\\nZuse died on 18 December 1995 in Hünfeld, Hesse (near Fulda) from heart failure.\\n\\nZuse the entrepreneur\\n Zuse\\'s workshop at Neukirchen (photograph taken in January 2010)\\n Magnetic drum storage inside a Z31 (which was first displayed in 1963).\\nDuring World War 2, Zuse founded one of the earliest computer companies: the Zuse-Ingenieurbüro Hopferau. Capital was raised in 1946 through ETH Zurich and an IBM option on Zuse\\'s patents.\\nZuse founded another company, Zuse KG in Haunetal-Neukirchen in 1949; in 1957 the company\\'s head office moved to Bad Hersfeld. The Z4 was finished and delivered to the ETH Zurich, Switzerland in September 1950. At that time, it was the only working computer in continental Europe, and the second computer in the world to be sold, beaten only by the BINAC, which never worked properly after it was delivered. Other computers, all numbered with a leading Z, up to Z43,[39] were built by Zuse and his company. Notable are the Z11, which was sold to the optics industry and to universities, and the Z22, the first computer with a memory based on magnetic storage.[40]\\nBy 1967, the Zuse KG had built a total of 251 computers. Owing to financial problems, the company was then sold to Siemens.\\n\\nCalculating Space\\n An elementary process in Zuse\\'s Calculating Space: Two digital particles A und B form a new digital particle C.[41]\\nIn 1967, Zuse also suggested that the universe itself is running on a cellular automaton or similar computational structure (digital physics); in 1969, he published the book Rechnender Raum (translated into English as Calculating Space). This idea has attracted a lot of attention, since there is no physical evidence against Zuse\\'s thesis. Edward Fredkin (1980s), Jürgen Schmidhuber (1990s), and others have expanded on it.\\n\\nAwards and honours\\nZuse received several awards for his work:\\n\\nWerner von Siemens Ring in 1964 (together with Fritz Leonhardt and Walter Schottky)[42]\\nHarry H.

1953), often known by his initials, rms,[1] (also his email ID), and occasionally upper-case RMS, is an American free software movement activist and programmer. He campaigns for software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive the freedoms to use, study, distribute, and modify that software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed free software. Stallman launched the GNU Project, founded the Free Software Foundation, developed the GNU Compiler Collection and GNU Emacs, and wrote the GNU General Public License.\\nStallman launched the GNU Project in September 1983 to create a Unix-like computer operating system composed entirely of free software.[2] With this, he also launched the free software movement. He has been the GNU project\\'s lead architect and organizer, and developed a number of pieces of widely used GNU software including, among others, the GNU Compiler Collection,[3] GNU Debugger,[4] and GNU Emacs text editor.[5] In October 1985[6] he founded the Free Software Foundation.\\nStallman pioneered the concept of copyleft, which uses the principles of copyright law to preserve the right to use, modify, and distribute free software, and is the main author of free software licenses which describe those terms, most notably the GNU General Public License (GPL), the most widely used free software license.[7]\\nIn 1989, he co-founded the League for Programming Freedom. Since the mid-1990s, Stallman has spent most of his time advocating for free software, as well as campaigning against software patents, digital rights management (which he referred to as digital restrictions management, calling the more common term misleading), and other legal and technical systems which he sees as taking away users\\' freedoms. This has included software license agreements, non-disclosure agreements, activation keys, dongles, copy restriction, proprietary formats, and binary executables without source code.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Early life\\n\\n1.1 Harvard University and MIT\\n\\n\\n2 Events leading to GNU\\n3 GNU project\\n4 Activism\\n\\n4.1 Copyright reduction\\n4.2 Surveillance resistance\\n\\n\\n5 Terminology\\n\\n5.1 Rejections\\n\\n5.1.1 Open source for free software\\n5.1.2 Linux for the GNU Project\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6 Personal life\\n7 Honors and awards\\n8 Selected publications\\n9 See also\\n10 References\\n11 External links\\n\\n\\nEarly life[edit]\\nStallman was born March 16, 1953,[8] in New York City, to a family of Jewish heritage.[9] His parents are Alice Lippman, a school teacher, and Daniel Stallman, a printing press broker. Stallman had a difficult relationship with his parents, as his father had a drinking habit and verbally abused his stepmother. He later came to describe his parents as \"tyrants\".[10] He was interested in computers at a young age; when Stallman was a pre-teen at a summer camp, he read manuals for the IBM 7094.[11] From 1967 to 1969, Stallman attended a Columbia University Saturday program for high school students.[11] Stallman was also a volunteer laboratory assistant in the biology department at Rockefeller University. Although he was interested in mathematics and physics, his teaching professor at Rockefeller thought he showed promise as a biologist.[12]\\nHis first experience with actual computers was at the IBM New York Scientific Center when he was in high school. He was hired for the summer in 1970, following his senior year of high school, to write a numerical analysis program in Fortran.[11] He completed the task after a couple of weeks (\"I swore that I would never use FORTRAN again because I despised it as a language compared with other languages\") and spent the rest of the summer writing a text editor in APL[13] and a preprocessor for the PL/I programming language on the IBM System/360.[14]\\n\\nHarvard University and MIT[edit]\\nAs a first-year student at Harvard University in fall 1970, Stallman was known for his strong performance in Math 55.[15] He was happy: \"For the first time in my life, I felt I had found a home at Harvard.\"[11]\\nIn 1971, near the end of his first year at Harvard, he became a programmer at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and became a regular in the hacker community, where he was usually known by his initials, RMS (which he used in his computer accounts).[1][16] Stallman received a bachelor\\'s degree in physics (magna cum laude) from Harvard in 1974.[17]\\nStallman considered staying on at Harvard, but instead he decided to enroll as a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He pursued a doctorate in physics for one year, but left that program to focus on his programming at the MIT AI Laboratory.[11][14]\\nWhile working (starting in 1975) as a research assistant at MIT under Gerry Sussman,[14] Stallman published a paper (with Sussman) in 1977 on an AI truth maintenance system, called dependency-directed backtracking.[18] This paper was an early work on the problem of intelligent backtracking in constraint satisfaction problems. As of 2009[update], the technique Stallman and Sussman introduced is still the most general and powerful form of intelligent backtracking.[19] The technique of constraint recording, wherein partial results of a search are recorded for later reuse, was also introduced in this paper.[19]\\nAs a hacker in MIT\\'s AI laboratory, Stallman worked on software projects such as TECO, Emacs for ITS, and the Lisp machine operating system (the CONS of 1974–1976 and the CADR of 1977–1979—this latter unit was commercialized by Symbolics and LMI starting around 1980).[16] He would become an ardent critic of restricted computer access in the lab, which at that time was funded primarily by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). When MIT\\'s Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) installed a password control system in 1977, Stallman found a way to decrypt the passwords and sent users messages containing their decoded password, with a suggestion to change it to the empty string (that is, no password) instead, to re-enable anonymous access to the systems. Around 20 percent of the users followed his advice at the time, although passwords ultimately prevailed. Stallman boasted of the success of his campaign for many years afterward.[20]\\n\\nEvents leading to GNU[edit]\\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the hacker culture that Stallman thrived on began to fragment. To prevent software from being used on their competitors\\' computers, most manufacturers stopped distributing source code and began using copyright and restrictive software licenses to limit or prohibit copying and redistribution. Such proprietary software had existed before, and it became apparent that it would become the norm. This shift in the legal characteristics of software was a consequence triggered by the US Copyright Act of 1976.[21]\\nWhen Brian Reid in 1979 placed time bombs in the Scribe markup language and word processing system to restrict unlicensed access to the software, Stallman proclaimed it \"a crime against humanity\".[14] During an interview in 2008, he clarified that it is blocking the user\\'s freedom that he believes is a crime, not the issue of charging for software.[22] Stallman\\'s texinfo is a GPL replacement, loosely based on Scribe;[23] the original version was finished in 1986.[24]\\nIn 1980, Stallman and some other hackers at the AI Lab were refused access to the source code for the software of a newly installed laser printer, the Xerox 9700. Stallman had modified the software for the Lab\\'s previous laser printer (the XGP, Xerographic Printer), so it electronically messaged a user when the person\\'s job was printed, and would message all logged-in users waiting for print jobs if the printer was jammed. Not being able to add these features to the new printer was a major inconvenience, as the printer was on a different floor from most of the users. This experience convinced Stallman of people\\'s need to be able to freely modify the software they use.[25]\\nRichard Greenblatt, a fellow AI Lab hacker, founded Lisp Machines, Inc. (LMI) to market Lisp machines, which he and Tom Knight designed at the lab. Greenblatt rejected outside investment, believing that the proceeds from the construction and sale of a few machines could be profitably reinvested in the growth of the company. In contrast, the other hackers felt that the venture capital-funded approach was better. As no agreement could be reached, hackers from the latter camp founded Symbolics, with the aid of Russ Noftsker, an AI Lab administrator. Symbolics recruited most of the remaining hackers including notable hacker Bill Gosper, who then left the AI Lab. Symbolics also forced Greenblatt to resign by citing MIT policies. While both companies delivered proprietary software, Stallman believed that LMI, unlike Symbolics, had tried to avoid hurting the lab\\'s community. For two years, from 1982 to the end of 1983, Stallman worked by himself to clone the output of the Symbolics programmers, with the aim of preventing them from gaining a monopoly on the lab\\'s computers.[20]\\nStallman argues that software users should have the freedom to share with their neighbors and be able to study and make changes to the software that they use. He maintains that attempts by proprietary software vendors to prohibit these acts are antisocial and unethical.[26] The phrase \"software wants to be free\" is often incorrectly attributed to him, and Stallman argues that this is a misstatement of his philosophy.[27] He argues that freedom is vital for the sake of users and society as a moral value, and not merely for pragmatic reasons such as possibly developing technically superior software.[28] Eric S. Raymond, one of the creators of the open-source movement,[29] argues that moral arguments, rather than pragmatic ones, alienate potential allies and hurt the end goal of removing code secrecy.[30]\\nIn February 1984, Stallman quit his job at MIT to work full-time on the GNU project, which he had announced in September 1983. Since then, he has remained affiliated with MIT as an unpaid[31] visiting scientist in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.[32] Until \"around 1998\", he maintained an office at the Institute that doubled as his legal residence.[33]\\n\\nGNU project[edit]\\nMain article: GNU Project\\nStallman announced the plan for the GNU operating system in September 1983 on several ARPANET mailing lists and USENET[2][34]. He started the project on his own and describes: \"As an operating system developer, I had the right skills for this job. So even though I could not take success for granted, I realized that I was elected to do the job. I chose to make the system compatible with Unix so that it would be portable, and so that Unix users could easily switch to it.\"[35]\\n\\n Stallman in 2003 at the opening ceremony of NIXAL (a GLUG) at Netaji Subhash Engineering College, Calcutta, India\\nIn 1985, Stallman published the GNU Manifesto, which outlined his motivation for creating a free operating system called GNU, which would be compatible with Unix.[16] The name GNU is a recursive acronym for \"GNU\\'s Not Unix\".[16] Soon after, he started a nonprofit corporation called the Free Software Foundation to employ free software programmers and provide a legal infrastructure for the free software movement. Stallman is the nonsalaried president of the FSF, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded in Massachusetts.[36] Stallman popularized the concept of copyleft, a legal mechanism to protect the modification and redistribution rights for free software. It was first implemented in the GNU Emacs General Public License, and in 1989 the first program-independent GNU General Public License (GPL) was released. By then, much of the GNU system had been completed.\\nStallman was responsible for contributing many necessary tools, including a text editor (Emacs), compiler (GCC), debugger (GNU Debugger), and a build automator (GNU make). The notable omission was a kernel. In 1990, members of the GNU project began using Carnegie Mellon\\'s Mach microkernel in a project called GNU Hurd, which has yet to achieve the maturity level required for full POSIX compliance.\\nIn 1991, Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, used the GNU\\'s development tools to produce the free monolithic Linux kernel. The existing programs from the GNU project were readily ported to run on the resultant platform. Most sources use the name Linux to refer to the general-purpose operating system thus formed, while Stallman and the FSF call it GNU/Linux. This has been a longstanding naming controversy in the free software community. Stallman argues that not using GNU in the name of the operating system unfairly disparages the value of the GNU project and harms the sustainability of the free software movement by breaking the link between the software and the free software philosophy of the GNU project.\\n\\n Cover picture for O\\'Reilly Media\\'s book Free as in Freedom\\nStallman\\'s influences on hacker culture include the name POSIX[37] and the Emacs editor. On Unix systems, GNU Emacs\\'s popularity rivaled that of another editor vi, spawning an editor war. Stallman\\'s take on this was to canonize himself as St. IGNUcius of the Church of Emacs[38][39] and acknowledge that \"vi vi vi is the editor of the beast\", while \"using a free version of vi is not a sin; it is a penance\".[40] On his homepage Stallman explains what a life in the Church of Emacs means to its members: \"Sainthood in the Church of Emacs requires living a life of purity—but in the Church of Emacs, this does not require celibacy (a sigh of relief is heard)\".[39]\\nIn 1992, developers at Lucid Inc. doing their own work on Emacs clashed with Stallman and ultimately forked the software into what would become XEmacs.[41] The technology journalist Andrew Leonard has characterized what he sees as Stallman\\'s uncompromising stubbornness as common among elite computer programmers:\\n\\n.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}There\\'s something comforting about Stallman\\'s intransigence. Win or lose, Stallman will never give up. He\\'ll be the stubbornest mule on the farm until the day he dies. Call it fixity of purpose, or just plain cussedness, his single-minded commitment and brutal honesty are refreshing in a world of spin-meisters and multimillion-dollar marketing campaigns.[42]\\n\\nActivism[edit]\\nStallman has written many essays on software freedom, and has been an outspoken political campaigner for the free software movement since the early 1990s.[16] The speeches he has regularly given are titled The GNU Project and the Free Software Movement,[43] The Dangers of Software Patents,[44] and Copyright and Community in the Age of Computer Networks.[45] In 2006 and 2007, during the eighteen month public consultation for the drafting of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, he added a fourth topic explaining the proposed changes.[46]\\nLinus Torvalds has criticized Stallman for what he considers \"black-and-white thinking\".[47]\\nStallman\\'s staunch advocacy for free software inspired the creation of the Virtual Richard M. Stallman (vrms), software that analyzes the packages currently installed on a Debian GNU/Linux system, and reports those that are from the non-free tree.[48] Stallman disagrees with parts of Debian\\'s definition of free software.[49]\\nIn 1999, Stallman called for development of a free online encyclopedia through the means of inviting the public to contribute articles.[50] The resulting GNUPedia was eventually retired in favour of the emerging Wikipedia, which had similar aims and was enjoying greater success.[51]\\nStallman is a world traveler and has visited at least 65 countries, mostly to speak about free software and the GNU project.[52] According to Stallman, the free software movement has much in common with that of Mahatma Gandhi.[53] Stallman is also highly critical of the effect that drug patents have had on developing countries.[54][55]\\n\\n Stallman giving a speech on \"Free Software and Your Freedom\" at the biennale du design of Saint-Étienne (2008)\\nIn Venezuela, Stallman has delivered public speeches and promoted the adoption of free software in the state\\'s oil company (PDVSA), in municipal government, and in the nation\\'s military. In meetings with Hugo Chávez and in public speeches, Stallman criticised some policies on television broadcasting, free speech rights, and privacy.[56][57] Stallman was on the Advisory Council of Latin American television station teleSUR from its launch[58] but resigned in February 2011, criticizing pro-Gaddafi propaganda during the Arab Spring.[59]\\nIn August 2006, at his meetings with the government of the Indian State of Kerala, he persuaded officials to discard proprietary software, such as Microsoft\\'s, at state-run schools. This has resulted in a landmark decision to switch all school computers in 12,500 high schools from Windows to a free software operating system.[60]\\nAfter personal meetings, Stallman obtained positive statements about the free software movement from the then-president of India, A.\\xa0P.\\xa0J. Abdul Kalam,[61] French 2007 presidential candidate Ségolène Royal,[62] and the president of Ecuador Rafael Correa.[63]\\nOn November 30, 2012, Stallman gave the opening lecture at the Goiano Free Software Forum in Brazil, talking about successful cases of switching to free software in government, business and at universities.[64]\\nStallman has participated in protests about software patents,[65] digital rights management,[66][67] and proprietary software.\\nProtesting against proprietary software in April 2006, Stallman held a \"Don\\'t buy from ATI, enemy of your freedom\" placard at a speech by an ATI representative in the building where Stallman worked, resulting in the police being called.[68] ATI has since merged with AMD Corporation and has taken steps to make their hardware documentation available for use by the free software community.[69]\\nIn response to Apple\\'s Macintosh look and feel lawsuits against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard in 1988, Stallman called for a boycott of Apple products on the grounds that a successful look-and-feel lawsuit would \"put an end to free software that could substitute for commercial software\".[70] The boycott was lifted in 1995, which meant the FSF started to accept patches to GNU software for Apple operating systems.[71]\\n\\n Stallman using his Lemote machine at Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai\\nStallman has characterized Steve Jobs as having a \"malign influence\" on computing because of Jobs\\' leadership in guiding Apple to produce closed platforms.[72][73] In 1993, while Jobs was at NeXT, Jobs asked Stallman if he could distribute a modified GCC in two parts, one part under GPL and the other part, an Objective-C preprocessor under a proprietary license. Stallman initially thought this would be legal, but since he also thought it would be \"very undesirable for free software\", he asked a lawyer for advice. The response he got was that judges would consider such schemes to be \"subterfuges\" and would be very harsh toward them, and a judge would ask whether it was \"really\" one program, rather than how the parts were labeled. Therefore, Stallman sent a message back to Jobs which said they believed Jobs\\' plan was not allowed by the GPL, which resulted in NeXT releasing the Objective-C front end under GPL.[74]\\nCommenting on Jobs\\' death, he said, \"As Chicago Mayor Harold Washington said of the corrupt former Mayor Daley, \\'I\\'m not glad he\\'s dead, but I\\'m glad he\\'s gone.\\'\"[73]\\nStallman\\'s remark stirred up accusations of being in bad taste, while Eric S. Raymond, author of The Cathedral and the Bazaar, observed that Stallman\\'s statement was not personal, but was simply criticizing walled gardens.[72]\\nFor a period of time, Stallman used a notebook from the One Laptop per Child program. Stallman\\'s computer is a refurbished ThinkPad T400s with Libreboot, a free BIOS replacement, and the GNU/Linux distribution Trisquel.[75] Before the ThinkPad T400s, Stallman used a Thinkpad X60 with Libreboot and Trisquel GNU/Linux.[76] And before the X60, Stallman used the Lemote Yeeloong netbook (using the same company\\'s Loongson processor) which he chose because, like the X60 and the T400s, it could run with free software at the BIOS level, stating \"freedom is my priority. I\\'ve campaigned for freedom since 1983, and I am not going to surrender that freedom for the sake of a more convenient computer.\"[77] Stallman\\'s Lemote was stolen from him in 2012 while in Argentina.[78] Before Trisquel, Stallman has used the gNewSense operating system.[79][80]\\n\\nCopyright reduction[edit]\\nStallman has regularly given a talk entitled \"Copyright vs. Community\" where he reviews the state of digital rights management (DRM) and names many of the products and corporations which he boycotts. His approach to DRM is best summed up by the FSF Defective by Design campaign. In the talks, he makes proposals for a \"reduced copyright\" and suggests a 10-year limit on copyright. He suggests that, instead of restrictions on sharing, authors be supported using a tax, with revenues distributed among them based on cubic roots of their popularity to ensure that \"fairly successful non-stars\" receive a greater share than they do now (compare with private copying levy which is associated with proponents of strong copyright), or a convenient anonymous micropayment system for people to support authors directly. He indicates that no form of non-commercial sharing of copies should be considered a copyright violation.[81][82] He has advocated civil disobedience in a comment on Ley Sinde.[82][83]\\nStallman has also helped and supported the International Music Score Library Project in getting back online, after it had been taken down on October 19, 2007, following a cease and desist letter from Universal Edition.[84]\\n\\n Stallman at Swatantra 2014, a conference organized by ICFOSS in Kerala, India\\nStallman mentions the dangers some e-books bring compared to paper books, with the example of the Amazon Kindle e-reader that prevents the copying of e-books and allows Amazon to order automatic deletion of a book. He says that such e-books present a big step backward with respect to paper books by being less easy to use, copy, lend to others or sell, also mentioning that Amazon e-books cannot be bought anonymously. His short story \"The Right to Read\" provides a picture of a dystopian future if the right to share books is impeded. He objects to many of the terms within typical end-user license agreements that accompany e-books.[82][84][85]\\nStallman discourages the use of several storage technologies such as DVD or Blu-ray video discs because the content of such media is encrypted. He considers manufacturers\\' use of encryption on non-secret data (to force the user to view certain promotional material) as a conspiracy.[86]\\nHe recognized the Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal to be a criminal act by Sony. Stallman supports a general boycott of Sony for its legal actions against George Hotz.[87]\\nStallman has suggested that the United States government may encourage the use of software as a service because this would allow them to access users\\' data without needing a search warrant.[88][89][90][91]\\nHe denies being an anarchist despite his wariness of some legislation and the fact that he has \"advocated strongly for user privacy and his own view of software freedom\".[92]\\n\\nSurveillance resistance[edit]\\nStallman professes admiration for whistleblowers Julian Assange[93] and Edward Snowden;[94] he advocates for Snowden in a prefix at the beginning of each of his emails, which can be found in several mailing lists, after Snowden leaked the PRISM scandal in 2013: \"To any NSA and FBI agents reading my email: please consider whether defending the US Constitution against all enemies, foreign or domestic, requires you to follow Snowden\\'s example.\"\\n\\nTerminology[edit]\\n Stallman, in costume as St. IGNUcius, wears a halo consisting of the platter of an old hard disk drive.[39] (Monastir, Tunisia, 2012)\\nStallman places great importance on the words and labels people use to talk about the world, including the relationship between software and freedom. He asks people to say free software and GNU/Linux, and to avoid the terms intellectual property and piracy (in relation to copyright). One of his criteria for giving an interview to a journalist is that the journalist agree to use his terminology throughout the article.[95] He has been known to turn down speaking requests over some terminology issues.[96]\\nStallman argues that the term intellectual property is designed to confuse people, and is used to prevent intelligent discussion on the specifics of copyright, patent, trademark, and other laws by lumping together areas of law that are more dissimilar than similar.[97] He also argues that by referring to these laws as property laws, the term biases the discussion when thinking about how to treat these issues, writing:\\n\\nThese laws originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues. Copyright law was designed to promote authorship and art, and covers the details of a work of authorship or art. Patent law was intended to encourage publication of ideas, at the price of finite monopolies over these ideas\\xa0– a price that may be worth paying in some fields and not in others. Trademark law was not intended to promote any business activity, but simply to enable buyers to know what they are buying.[98]\\n\\nAn example of cautioning others to avoid other terminology while also offering suggestions for possible alternatives is this sentence of an e-mail by Stallman to a public mailing list:\\n\\nI think it is ok for authors (please let\\'s not call them creators, they are not gods) to ask for money for copies of their works (please let\\'s not devalue these works by calling them content) in order to gain income (the term compensation falsely implies it is a matter of making up for some kind of damages).[99]\\n\\nRejections[edit]\\nOpen source for free software[edit]\\nHis requests that people use certain terms, and his ongoing efforts to convince people of the importance of terminology, are a source of regular misunderstanding and friction with parts of the free software and open-source communities.\\nAfter initially accepting the concept,[100] Stallman rejects a common alternative term, open-source software, because it does not call to mind what Stallman sees as the value of the software: freedom.[101] He wrote, \"Free software is a political movement; open source is a development model.\"[102] Thus, he believes that the use of the term will not inform people of the freedom issues, and will not lead to people valuing and defending their freedom.[103] Two alternatives which Stallman does accept are software libre and unfettered software, but free software is the term he asks people to use in English. For similar reasons, he argues for the term proprietary software rather than closed-source software, when referring to software that is not free software.\\n\\nLinux for the GNU Project[edit]\\nMain article: GNU/Linux naming controversy\\nStallman asks that the term GNU/Linux, which he pronounces /ɡnuː slæʃ ˈlɪnəks/ GNOO SLASH LIN-əks, be used to refer to the operating system created by combining the GNU system and the kernel Linux. Stallman refers to this operating system as \"a variant of GNU, and the GNU Project is its principal developer\".[96] He claims that the connection between the GNU project\\'s philosophy and its software is broken when people refer to the combination as merely Linux.[104]  Starting around 2003, he began also using the term GNU+Linux, which he pronounces /ɡnuː plʌs ˈlɪnəks/ GNOO PLUS LIN-əks, to prevent others from pronouncing the phrase GNU/Linux as /ɡnuː ˈlɪnəks/ GNOO LIN-əks, which would erroneously imply that the kernel Linux is maintained by the GNU project.[citation needed] . The creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds, has publicly stated that he objects to modification of the name, and that the rename \"is their[the FSF] confusion not ours\".[105]\\n\\nPersonal life[edit]\\nStallman has said that he is \"an atheist of Jewish ancestry\"[9] and often wears a button that reads \"Impeach God\".[15][106]\\nStallman refers to mobile phones as \"portable surveillance and tracking devices\",[107] refusing to own a cell phone due to the lack of phones running entirely on free software.[108] He also avoids using a key card to enter his office building[52] since key card systems track each location and time that someone enters the building using a card. According to Stallman, with the exception of a few sites, such as his own website or sites related to his work with GNU and the FSF, he usually does not browse the web directly from his personal computer in order to prevent being connected with his browsing history. Instead, he uses GNU Womb\\'s grab-url-from-mail utility, which can run on a separate system, and act as an email-based proxy to web sites: the user sends an e-mail which the script receives, the remote system downloads the web page content, and then the script emails the user the web page content.[109][110] More recently he stated that he accesses all web sites via Tor, except for Wikipedia (which generally disallows editing from Tor).[111][112]\\nStallman is openly childfree.[113] He has urged others to not have children, viewing it as objectionable for reasons centered on family tensions and overpopulation.[113] He argues that not having children better liberates people to find more productive ways to \"make a positive contribution to the world\".[113]\\nStallman has written a collection of filk and parody songs, granting unlimited permission to sing and perform them.[114]\\nAccording to his lifestyle FAQ, he enjoys science fiction.[115]\\nHe speaks English, French, Spanish and some Indonesian.[33]\\nStallman resides in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[33]\\n\\n Honors and awards[edit]\\nStallman has received recognition for his work, including:\\n\\n1986: Honorary lifetime membership of the Chalmers University of Technology Computer Society[116]\\n1990: Exceptional merit award MacArthur Fellowship (\"genius grant\")[117]\\n1990: The Association for Computing Machinery\\'s Grace Murray Hopper Award \"For pioneering work in the development of the extensible editor EMACS (Editing Macros)\"[118]\\n1996: Honorary doctorate from Sweden\\'s Royal Institute of Technology[119]\\n1998: Electronic Frontier Foundation\\'s Pioneer award[120]\\n1999: Yuri Rubinsky Memorial Award[121]\\n2001: The Takeda Techno-Entrepreneurship Award for Social/Economic Well-Being (武田研究奨励賞)[122][123]\\n2001: Honorary doctorate, from the University of Glasgow[124]\\n2002: United States National Academy of Engineering membership[125]\\n2003: Honorary doctorate, from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel[126]\\n2004: Honorary doctorate, from the Universidad Nacional de Salta[127]\\n2004: Honorary professorship, from the Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería del Perú[128]\\n2007: Honorary professorship, from the Universidad Inca Garcilaso de la Vega\\xa0[es] [2][129]\\n2007: First Premio Internacional Extremadura al Conocimiento Libre[130]\\n2007: Honorary doctorate, from the Universidad de Los Angeles de Chimbote[131]\\n2007: Honorary doctorate, from the University of Pavia[132]\\n2008: Honorary doctorate from the Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, in Peru[citation needed]\\n2009: Honorary doctorate, from Lakehead University[133][134]\\n2011: Honorary doctorate, from National University of Córdoba[135]\\n2012: Honorary professorship, from the Universidad César Vallejo de Trujillo, in Peru[citation needed]\\n2012: Honorary doctorate, from the Universidad Latinoamericana Cima de Tacna, in Peru[citation needed]\\n2012: Honorary doctorate, from the Universidad José Faustino Sánchez Carrió, in Peru[citation needed]\\n2014: Honorary doctorate, from Concordia University, in Montréal[136]\\n2015: ACM Software System Award \"For the development and leadership of GCC\"[118]\\n2016: Honorary doctorate, from Pierre and Marie Curie University[137]\\n2016: Social Medicine award, from GNU Solidario[138]\\nSelected publications[edit]\\nManuals\\n\\nStallman, Richard M (1980).

Lovelace\\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\nJump to navigation\\nJump to search\\nEnglish mathematician, computer programming pioneer\\nThe Right HonourableThe Countess of LovelaceA c. 1843 daguerreotype by Antoine Claudet[1]BornThe Hon. Augusta Ada Byron(1815-12-10)10 December 1815London, EnglandDied27 November 1852(1852-11-27) (aged\\xa036)Marylebone, London, EnglandResting placeChurch of St. Mary Magdalene, Hucknall, Nottingham, EnglandKnown\\xa0forMathematics, computingSpouse(s)William King-Noel, 1st Earl of LovelaceChildren\\nByron King-Noel, Viscount Ockham and 12th Baron Wentworth\\nAnne Blunt, 15th Baroness Wentworth\\nRalph King-Milbanke, 2nd Earl of Lovelace\\nAugusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10\\xa0December 1815\\xa0– 27\\xa0November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage\\'s proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a \"computing machine\" and one of the first computer programmers.[2][3][4]\\nLovelace was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron and his wife Lady Byron.[5] All of Byron\\'s other children were born out of wedlock to other women.[6] Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later. He commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, \"Is thy face like thy mother\\'s my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?\".[7] He died of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada\\'s interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father\\'s perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in Byron and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.\\nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \"poetical science\"[8] and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\".[9]\\nWhen she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, also known as \"the father of computers\", and in particular, Babbage\\'s work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville.\\nBetween 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the calculating engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called Notes. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage\\'s personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine.[10] Lovelace\\'s notes are important in the early history of computers. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.[11] Her mindset of \"poetical science\" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.[6]\\nShe died of uterine cancer in 1852 at the age of 36.\\nContents\\n1 Biography\\n1.1 Childhood\\n1.2 Adult years\\n1.3 Education\\n1.4 Death\\n2 Work\\n2.1 First computer program\\n2.2 Insight into potential of computing devices\\n2.3 Controversy over her actual contribution\\n3 In popular culture\\n4 Commemoration\\n5 Bicentenary\\n6 Publications\\n7 Publication history\\n8 See also\\n9 Notes\\n10 References\\n11 Sources\\n12 Further reading\\n13 External links\\nBiography\\nChildhood\\nAda Byron, aged four\\nLord Byron expected his child to be a \"glorious boy\" and was disappointed when Lady Byron gave birth to a girl.[12] The child was named after Byron\\'s half-sister, Augusta Leigh, and was called \"Ada\" by Byron himself.[13] On 16\\xa0January 1816, at Lord Byron\\'s command, Lady Byron left for her parents\\' home at Kirkby Mallory, taking their five-week-old daughter with her.[12] Although English law at the time granted full custody of children to the father in cases of separation, Lord Byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights,[14] but did request that his sister keep him informed of Ada\\'s welfare.[15]\\nAda Byron, aged seven, by Alfred d\\'Orsay, 1822, Somerville College, Oxford.\\nOn 21\\xa0April, Lord Byron signed the deed of separation, although very reluctantly, and left England for good a few days later.[16] Aside from an acrimonious separation, Lady Byron continued throughout her life to make allegations about her husband\\'s immoral behaviour.[17] This set of events made Lovelace infamous in Victorian society. She did not have a relationship with her father. He died in 1824 when she was eight years old. Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life.[18] Lovelace was not shown the family portrait of her father until her 20th birthday.[19]\\nLovelace did not have a close relationship with her mother. She was often left in the care of her maternal grandmother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke, who doted on her. However, because of societal attitudes of the time—which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation—Lady Byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about her daughter\\'s welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern.[20] In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to her daughter as \"it\": \"I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own.\"[21] Lady Byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for any sign of moral deviation. Lovelace dubbed these observers the \"Furies\" and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her.[22]\\nAda Byron, aged seventeen, 1832\\nLovelace was often ill, beginning in early childhood. At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision.[13] In June 1829, she was paralysed after a bout of measles. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, something which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite the illnesses, she developed her mathematical and technological skills. At the age of twelve, this future \"Lady Fairy\", as Charles Babbage affectionately called her, decided she wanted to fly. Ada Byron went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with imagination and passion. Her first step, in February 1828, was to construct wings. She investigated different material and sizes. She considered various materials for the wings: paper, oilsilk, wires, and feathers. She examined the anatomy of birds to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body. She decided to write a book, Flyology, illustrating, with plates, some of her findings. She decided what equipment she would need; for example, a compass, to \"cut across the country by the most direct road\", so that she could surmount mountains, rivers, and valleys. Her final step was to integrate steam with the \"art of flying\".[6]\\nIn early 1833, Ada Byron had an affair with a tutor. After being caught, she tried to elope with him but the tutor\\'s relatives recognised her and contacted her mother. Lady Byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal.[23] Lovelace never met her younger half-sister, Allegra, the daughter of Lord Byron and Claire Clairmont. Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five. Lovelace did have some contact with Elizabeth Medora Leigh, the daughter of Byron\\'s half-sister Augusta Leigh, who purposely avoided Lovelace as much as possible when introduced at court.[24]\\nAdult years\\nWatercolour portrait of Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, circa 1840, possibly by Alfred Edward Chalon\\nLovelace became close friends with her tutor Mary Somerville, who introduced her to Charles Babbage in 1833. She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville,[25] and they corresponded for many years. Other acquaintances included the scientists Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens. She was presented at Court at the age of seventeen \"and became a popular belle of the season\" in part because of her \"brilliant mind.\"[26] By 1834 Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and was able to charm many people, and was described by most people as being dainty, although John Hobhouse, Byron\\'s friend, described her as \"a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend\\'s features, particularly the mouth\".[27] This description followed their meeting on 24\\xa0February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably due to her mother\\'s influence, which led her to dislike all of her father\\'s friends. This first impression was not to last, and they later became friends.[28]\\nOn 8 July 1835, she married William, 8th Baron King, becoming Lady King.[29] They had three homes: Ockham Park, Surrey; a Scottish estate on Loch Torridon in Ross-shire; and a house in London. They spent their honeymoon at Worthy Manor in Ashley Combe near Porlock Weir, Somerset. The Manor had been built as a hunting lodge in 1799 and was improved by King in preparation for their honeymoon. It later became their summer retreat and was further improved during this time. From 1845, the family\\'s main house was East Horsley Towers, rebuilt in the Victorian Gothic fashion by the architect of the Houses of Parliament, Charles Barry.[30][31]\\nThey had three children: Byron (born 12\\xa0May 1836); Anne Isabella (called Annabella; born 22\\xa0September 1837); and Ralph Gordon (born 2\\xa0July 1839). Immediately after the birth of Annabella, Lady King experienced \"a tedious and suffering illness, which took months to cure.\"[28] Ada was a descendant of the extinct Barons Lovelace and in 1838, her husband was made Earl of Lovelace and Viscount Ockham,[32] meaning Ada became the Countess of Lovelace. In 1843–44, Ada\\'s mother assigned William Benjamin Carpenter to teach Ada\\'s children and to act as a \"moral\" instructor for Ada.[33] He quickly fell for her and encouraged her to express any frustrated affections, claiming that his marriage meant he would never act in an \"unbecoming\" manner. When it became clear that Carpenter was trying to start an affair, Ada cut it off.[34]\\nIn 1841, Lovelace and Medora Leigh (the daughter of Lord Byron\\'s half-sister Augusta Leigh) were told by Ada\\'s mother that her father was also Medora\\'s father.[35] On 27\\xa0February 1841, Ada wrote to her mother: \"I am not in the least astonished. In fact, you merely confirm what I have for years and years felt scarcely a doubt about, but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in any way suspected.\"[36] She did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron, but instead blamed Augusta Leigh: \"I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was.\"[37] In the 1840s, Ada flirted with scandals: firstly, from a relaxed approach to extra-marital relationships with men, leading to rumours of affairs;[38] and secondly, from her love of gambling. She apparently lost more than £3,000 on the horses during the later 1840s.[39] The gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends, and an ambitious attempt in 1851 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets. This went disastrously wrong, leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate, forcing her to admit it all to her husband.[40] She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosse\\'s son John from 1844 onwards. John Crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement. She bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her.[41] During her final illness, she would panic at the idea of the younger Crosse being kept from visiting her.[42]\\nEducation\\nThroughout her illnesses, she continued her education.[43] Her mother\\'s obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age. She was privately schooled in mathematics and science by William Frend, William King,[a] and Mary Somerville, the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. One of her later tutors was the mathematician and logician Augustus De Morgan. From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge,[26] and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that her daughter\\'s skill in mathematics could lead her to become \"an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence\".[44]\\nLovelace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating poetry and science. While studying differential calculus, she wrote to De Morgan:\\nI may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one\\'s elbows in one shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar[45]\\nLovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts. She valued metaphysics as much as mathematics, viewing both as tools for exploring \"the unseen worlds around us\".[46]\\nDeath\\nPainting of Lovelace seated at a piano, by Henry Phillips (1852). Although in great pain at the time, she agreed to sit for the painting as her father, Lord Byron, had been painted by Phillips\\' father, Thomas Phillips.\\nLovelace died at the age of 36\\xa0– the same age at which her father had died\\xa0– on 27\\xa0November 1852,[47] from uterine cancer probably exacerbated by bloodletting by her physicians.[48] The illness lasted several months, in which time Annabella took command over whom Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and confidants. Under her mother\\'s influence, she had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor.[49] She lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on 30\\xa0August which caused him to abandon her bedside. It is not known what she told him.[50] She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque in Latin to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers.\\nWork\\nThroughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including phrenology[51] and mesmerism.[52] After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844 she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings (\"a calculus of the nervous system\").[53] She never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a long-running pre-occupation, inherited from her mother, about her \\'potential\\' madness. As part of her research into this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments.[54] In the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron Karl von Reichenbach, Researches on Magnetism, but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft.[55] In 1851, the year before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning \"certain productions\" she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music.[56]\\nPortrait of Ada by British painter Margaret Sarah Carpenter (1836)\\nLovelace first met Charles Babbage in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his difference engine.[57] She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could. Babbage was impressed by Lovelace\\'s intellect and analytic skills. He called her \"The Enchantress of Number\".[58][b] In 1843 he wrote to her:\\n.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}Forget this world and all its troubles and if possible its multitudinous Charlatans—every thing in short but the Enchantress of Number.[58]\\nDuring a nine-month period in 1842–43, Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea\\'s article on Babbage\\'s newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine. With the article, she appended a set of notes.[59] Explaining the Analytical Engine\\'s function was a difficult task, as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment had shown little interest in it.[60] Lovelace\\'s notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine.[61] Her work was well received at the time; the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing.[62]\\nThe notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include (in Note G),[63] in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers using the Analytical Engine, which might have run correctly had it ever been built[64] (only Babbage\\'s Difference Engine has been built, completed in London in 2002).[65] Based on this work, Lovelace is now widely considered to be the first computer programmer[2] and her method is recognised as the world\\'s first computer program.[66]\\nNote G also contains Lovelace\\'s dismissal of artificial intelligence. She wrote that \"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.\" This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by Alan Turing in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\".[67]\\nLovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published, when he tried to leave his own statement (criticising the government\\'s treatment of his Engine) as an unsigned preface, which could have been mistakenly interpreted as a joint declaration. When Taylor\\'s Scientific Memoirs ruled that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper. The historian Benjamin Woolley theorised that: \"His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada\\'s involvement, and so happily indulged her\\xa0... because of her \\'celebrated name\\'.\"[68] Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12\\xa0August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as Philosopher\\'s Walk, as it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles.[62]\\nFirst computer program\\nLovelace\\'s diagram from \"note G\", the first published computer algorithm\\nIn 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his Analytical Engine. Luigi Menabrea, a young Italian engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy, transcribed Babbage\\'s lecture into French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the Bibliothèque universelle de Genève in October 1842.\\nBabbage\\'s friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea\\'s paper into English. She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage. These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea\\'s paper, were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor\\'s Scientific Memoirs under the initialism AAL.[69]\\nAda Lovelace\\'s notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason.[70][71] The engine was never completed so her program was never tested.[72]\\nIn 1953, more than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace\\'s notes on Babbage\\'s Analytical Engine were republished as an appendix to B.V. Bowden\\'s Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines.[73] The engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software.[64]\\nInsight into potential of computing devices\\nIn her notes, Lovelace emphasised the difference between the Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines, particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity.[74] She realised the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crunching. In her notes, she wrote:\\n[The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.[75][76]\\nThis analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised. Walter Isaacson ascribes Lovelace\\'s insight regarding the application of computing to any process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles: \"When she saw some mechanical looms that used punchcards to direct the weaving of beautiful patterns, it reminded her of how Babbage\\'s engine used punched cards to make calculations.\"[77] This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley, as well as the programmer John Graham-Cumming, whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine.[78][79][80]\\nAccording to the historian of computing and Babbage specialist Doron Swade: Ada saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see. In Babbage\\'s world his engines were bound by number...What Lovelace saw—what Ada Byron saw—was that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation—to general-purpose computation—and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper.[2]\\nControversy over her actual contribution\\nThough Lovelace is referred to as the first computer programmer, some biographers, computer scientists and historians of computing claim otherwise.\\nAllan G. Bromley, in the 1990 article Difference and Analytical Engines:\\nAll but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Babbage from three to seven years earlier. The exception was prepared by Babbage for her, although she did detect a \\'bug\\' in it. Not only is there no evidence that Ada ever prepared a program for the Analytical Engine, but her correspondence with Babbage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so.[81]\\nBruce Collier, who later wrote a biography of Babbage, wrote in his 1970 Harvard University PhD thesis that Lovelace \"made a considerable contribution to publicizing the Analytical Engine, but there is no evidence that she advanced the design or theory of it in any way\".[82]\\nEugene Eric Kim and Betty Alexandra Toole consider it \"incorrect\" to regard Lovelace as the first computer programmer, as Babbage wrote the initial programs for his Analytical Engine, although the majority were never published.[83] Bromley notes several dozen sample programs prepared by Babbage between 1837 and 1840, all substantially predating Lovelace\\'s notes.[84] Dorothy K. Stein regards Lovelace\\'s notes as \"more a reflection of the mathematical uncertainty of the author, the political purposes of the inventor, and, above all, of the social and cultural context in which it was written, than a blueprint for a scientific development\".[85]\\nIn his book, Idea Makers, Stephen Wolfram defends Lovelace\\'s contributions. While acknowledging that Babbage wrote several unpublished algorithms for the Analytical Engine prior to Lovelace\\'s notes, Wolfram argues that \"there\\'s nothing as sophisticated—or as clean—as Ada\\'s computation of the Bernoulli numbers. Babbage certainly helped and commented on Ada\\'s work, but she was definitely the driver of it.\" Wolfram then suggests that Lovelace\\'s main achievement was to distill from Babbage\\'s correspondence \"a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machine—something which Babbage never did.\"[86][self-published source?]\\nDoron Swade, a specialist on history of computing known for his work on Babbage, analyzed four claims about Lovelace during a lecture on Babbage\\'s analytical engine:\\nShe was a mathematical genius\\nShe made an influential contribution to the analytical engine\\nShe was the first computer programmer\\nShe was a prophet of the computer age\\nAccording to him, only the fourth claim had \"any substance at all\". He explained that Ada was only a \"promising beginner\" instead of genius in mathematics, that she began studying basic concepts of mathematics five years after Babbage conceived the analytical engine so she could not have made important contributions to it, and that she only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it. But he agrees that Ada was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities.[87]\\nIn popular culture\\nAn illustration inspired by the A. E. Chalon portrait created for the Ada Initiative, which supported open technology and women\\nLovelace has been portrayed in Romulus Linney\\'s 1977 play Childe Byron,[88] the 1990 steampunk novel The Difference Engine by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling,[89] the 1997 film Conceiving Ada,[90] and in John Crowley\\'s 2005 novel Lord Byron\\'s Novel: The Evening Land, where she is featured as an unseen character whose personality is forcefully depicted in her annotations and anti-heroic efforts to archive her father\\'s lost novel.[91]\\nIn Tom Stoppard\\'s 1993 play Arcadia, the precocious teenage genius Thomasina Coverly (a character \"apparently based\" on Ada Lovelace—the play also involves Lord Byron) comes to understand chaos theory, and theorises the second law of thermodynamics, before either is officially recognised.[92][93] The 2015 play Ada and the Memory Engine by Lauren Gunderson portrays Lovelace and Charles Babbage in unrequited love, and it imagines a post-death meeting between Lovelace and her father.[94][95]\\nLovelace and Babbage are the main characters in Sydney Padua\\'s webcomic and graphic novel The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage. The comic features extensive footnotes on the history of Ada Lovelace, and many lines of dialogue are drawn from actual correspondence.[96]\\nLovelace and Mary Shelley as teenagers are the central characters in Jordan Stratford\\'s steampunk series, The Wollstonecraft Detective Agency.[97]\\nLovelace, identified as Ada Augusta Byron, is portrayed by Lily Lesser in the second season of The Frankenstein Chronicles.\\nShe is employed as an \"analyst\" to provide the workings of a life-sized humanoid automaton.\\nThe brass workings of the machine are reminiscent of Babbage\\'s analytical engine.\\nHer employment is described as keeping her occupied until she returns to her studies in advanced mathematics.[98]\\nAs of November 2015, all new British passports have included an illustration of Lovelace and Babbage on pages 46 and 47.[99][100]\\nIn 2017, a Google Doodle honoured her on International Women\\'s Day.[101]\\nLovelace and Babbage appear as characters in the second season of the ITV series Victoria (2017). Emerald Fennell portrays Lovelace in the episode, \"The Green-Eyed Monster\".[102]\\nThe Cardano platform uses ADA as the name for their cryptocurrency and Lovelace as the smallest sub-unit of an ADA.[103]\\nOn 2 February 2018, Satellogic, a high-resolution Earth observation imaging and analytics company, launched a ÑuSat type micro-satellite named in honor of Ada Lovelace.[104]\\nCommemoration\\nBlue plaque to Lovelace in St. James\\'s Square, London\\nThe computer language Ada, created on behalf of the United States Department of Defense, was named after Lovelace.[105] The reference manual for the language was approved on 10\\xa0December 1980 and the Department of Defense Military Standard for the language, MIL-STD-1815, was given the number of the year of her birth.\\nIn 1981, the Association for Women in Computing inaugurated its Ada Lovelace Award.[106][107] Since 1998, the British Computer Society (BCS) has awarded the Lovelace Medal,[108] and in 2008 initiated an annual competition for women students.[109] BCSWomen sponsors the Lovelace Colloquium, an annual conference for women undergraduates.[109] Ada College is a further-education college in Tottenham Hale, London, focused on digital skills.[110]\\nAda Lovelace Day is an annual event celebrated on the second Tuesday of October,[111] which began in 2009.[112] Its goal is to \"...\\xa0raise the profile of women in science, technology, engineering, and maths,\" and to \"create new role models for girls and women\" in these fields. Events have included Wikipedia edit-a-thons with the aim of improving the representation of women on Wikipedia in terms of articles and editors to reduce unintended gender bias on Wikipedia. The Ada Initiative was a non-profit organisation dedicated to increasing the involvement of women in the free culture and open source movements.[113]\\nThe Engineering in Computer Science and Telecommunications College building in Zaragoza University is called the Ada Byron Building.[114] The computer centre in the village of Porlock, near where Lovelace lived, is named after her. Ada Lovelace House is a council-owned building in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, near where Lovelace spent her infancy; the building, which formerly housed the local district council offices, now provides high-quality office space for a number of local start-up businesses.[115][116]\\nShe is also the inspiration and influence for the Ada Developers Academy in Seattle, Washington. The academy is a non-profit that seeks to increase diversity in tech by training women, trans and non-binary people to be software engineers.[117]\\nIn 2018, The New York Times published a belated obituary for Ada Lovelace.[118]\\nOn 27 July 2018, Senator Ron Wyden submitted, in the United States Senate, the designation of 9 October 2018 as National Ada Lovelace Day: \"To honor the life and contributions of Ada Lovelace as a leading woman in science and mathematics\". The resolution (S.Res.592)[119] was considered, and agreed to without amendment and with a preamble by unanimous consent.\\nBicentenary\\nThe bicentenary of Ada Lovelace\\'s birth was celebrated with a number of events, including:[120]\\nThe Ada Lovelace Bicentenary Lectures on Computability, Israel Institute for Advanced Studies, 20\\xa0December 2015 – 31\\xa0January 2016.[121][122]\\nAda Lovelace Symposium, University of Oxford, 13–14 October 2015.[123]\\nAda.Ada.Ada, a one-woman show about the life and work of Ada Lovelace (using an LED dress), premiered at Edinburgh International Science Festival on 11 April 2015,[124] and continues to touring internationally to promote diversity on STEM at technology conferences,[125][126] businesses, government and educational organisations.[127][128]\\nSpecial exhibitions were displayed by the Science Museum in London, England[129] and the Weston Library[130] (part of the Bodleian Library) in Oxford, England.\\nPublications\\nLovelace, Ada King.

For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.\\nTuring played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.[11][12] Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war,[13] but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14\\xa0million lives.[11]\\nAfter the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, which was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman\\'s Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers[14] and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis[1] and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.\\nTuring was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the Labouchere Amendment had mandated that \"gross indecency\" was a criminal offence in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES, as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.[15]\\nIn 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for \"the appalling way he was treated\". Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013.[16][17][18] The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.[19]\\n.mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 ul{display:none}Contents\\n1 Early life and education\\n1.1 Family\\n1.2 School\\n1.3 Christopher Morcom\\n1.4 University and work on computability\\n2 Career and research\\n2.1 Cryptanalysis\\n2.2 Bombe\\n2.3 Hut 8 and the naval Enigma\\n2.4 Turingery\\n2.5 Delilah\\n2.6 Early computers and the Turing test\\n2.7 Pattern formation and mathematical biology\\n3 Personal life\\n3.1 Conviction for indecency\\n3.2 Death\\n3.3 Government apology and pardon\\n4 Awards, honours, and tributes\\n4.1 Posthumous tributes\\n4.2 Centenary celebrations\\n4.3 Portrayal\\n4.3.1 In theatre\\n4.3.2 In literature\\n4.3.3 In music\\n4.3.4 In film\\n5 See also\\n6 References\\n6.1 Sources\\n7 Further reading\\n7.1 Articles\\n7.2 Books\\n8 External links\\nEarly life and education[edit]\\nFamily[edit]\\nTuring was born in Maida Vale, London,[6] while his father, Julius Mathison Turing (1873–1947), was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service (ICS) at Chatrapur, then in the Madras Presidency and presently in Odisha state, in India.[20][21]\\nTuring\\'s father was the son of a clergyman, the Rev.\\xa0John Robert Turing, from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet. Turing\\'s mother, Julius\\' wife, was Ethel Sara Turing (née Stoney 1881–1976),[6] daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the Madras Railways. The Stoneys were a Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry family from both County Tipperary and County Longford, while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in County Clare.[22]\\nJulius\\' work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been\\na general in the Bengal Army. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to Maida Vale,[23] London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth,[24][25] later the Colonnade Hotel.[20][26] Turing had an elder brother, John (the father of Sir John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the Turing baronets).[27]\\nTuring\\'s father\\'s civil service commission was still active and during Turing\\'s childhood years Turing\\'s parents travelled between Hastings in England[28] and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea, now marked with a blue plaque.[29] The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012, the centenary of Turing\\'s birth.[30]\\nVery early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently.[31] His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque.[32]\\nSchool[edit]\\nTuring\\'s parents enrolled him at St Michael\\'s, a day school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-Sea, at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on, as did many of his subsequent teachers.\\nBetween January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex (now East Sussex).[33] In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School, a boarding independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike in Britain, but he was so determined to attend, that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles (97\\xa0km) from Southampton to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.[34]\\nTuring\\'s natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents: \"I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist, he is wasting his time at a public school\".[35] Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein\\'s work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein\\'s questioning of Newton\\'s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.[36]\\nChristopher Morcom[edit]\\nAt Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom (1911 – 1930), who has been described as Turing\\'s \"first love\". Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing\\'s future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom\\'s death, in February 1930, from complications of bovine tuberculosis, contracted after drinking infected cow\\'s milk some years previously.[37][38][39]\\nThe event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom\\'s mother Turing said:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me\\xa0... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive, because that is what he would like me to do.[40]\\nTuring\\'s relationship with Morcom\\'s mother continued long after Morcom\\'s death, with her sending gifts to Turing, and him sending letters, typically on Morcom\\'s birthdays.[41] A day before the third anniversary of Morcom\\'s death (12 February, 1933), he wrote to Mrs. Morcom: I expect you will be thinking of Chris when this reaches you. I shall too, and this letter is just to tell you that I shall be thinking of Chris and of you tomorrow. I am sure that he is as happy now as he was when he was here. Your affectionate Alan.[42]\\nSome have speculated that Morcom\\'s death was the cause of Turing\\'s atheism and materialism.[43] Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter, also written to Morcom\\'s mother, Turing said: Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body\\xa0... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a \\'spirit\\', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies, the \\'mechanism\\' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later, perhaps immediately.[44]\\nUniversity and work on computability[edit]\\nAfter Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King\\'s College, Cambridge,[6] where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics. In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a fellow of King\\'s on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.[45] Unknown to the committee, the theorem had already been proven, in 1922, by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg.[46] A blue plaque at the college was unveiled on the centenary of his birth on 23 June 2012 and is now installed at the college\\'s Keynes Building on King\\'s Parade.[47][48]\\nIn 1936, Turing published his paper \"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\" (1936).[49] In this paper, Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel\\'s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel\\'s universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. The Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his \"universal computing machine\" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable: It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt.\\nKing\\'s College, Cambridge, where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him.\\nAlthough Turing\\'s proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church\\'s equivalent proof using his lambda calculus,[50] Turing\\'s approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church\\'s.[51] It also included a notion of a \\'Universal Machine\\' (now known as a universal Turing machine), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church\\'s lambda calculus). According to the Church–Turing thesis, Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing\\'s paper.[52] To this day, Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation.\\nFrom September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University,[4] in the second year as a Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.[53] In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton;[54] his dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals,[55][56] introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing, where Turing machines are augmented with so-called oracles, allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines. John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant, but he went back to England.[57]\\nCareer and research[edit]\\nWhen Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics.[58] The lectures have been reconstructed verbatim, including interjections from Turing and other students, from students\\' notes.[59] Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed, with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths, but rather invents them.[60]\\nCryptanalysis[edit]\\nDuring the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said, \"You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing\\'s was that genius.\"[61]\\nFrom September 1938, Turing had been working part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), the British codebreaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma with Dilly Knox, a senior GC&CS codebreaker.[62] Soon after the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Cipher Bureau had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of Enigma rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma code messages, Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem.[63] The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change, which they did in May 1940. Turing\\'s approach was more general, using crib-based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe (an improvement of the Polish Bomba).[64]\\nTwo cottages in the stable yard at Bletchley Park. Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940, before moving to Hut 8.\\nOn 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&CS.[65]\\nSpecifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were: deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy; developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus; developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40/42 (Tunny) dubbed Turingery and, towards the end of the war, the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah.\\nBy using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process, Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches, titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography[66] and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions,[67] which were of such value to GC&CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012, shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician, \"who identified himself only as Richard,\" said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance, and their relevance to post-war cryptanalysis:[68] [He] said the fact that the contents had been restricted \"shows what a tremendous importance it has in the foundations of our subject\". ... The papers detailed using \"mathematical analysis to try and determine which are the more likely settings so that they can be tried as quickly as possible.\" ... Richard said that GCHQ had now \"squeezed the juice\" out of the two papers and was \"happy for them to be released into the public domain\".\\nTuring had a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as \"Prof\" and his treatise on Enigma was known as the \"Prof\\'s Book\".[69] According to historian Ronald Lewin, Jack Good, a cryptanalyst who worked with Turing, said of his colleague:\\nIn the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off. His bicycle had a fault: the chain would come off at regular intervals. Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand. Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen.[70]\\nWhile working at Bletchley, Turing, who was a talented long-distance runner, occasionally ran the 40 miles (64\\xa0km) to London when he was needed for meetings,[71] and he was capable of world-class marathon standards.[72][73] Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team but he was hampered by an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards\\' Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He was Walton Athletic Club\\'s best runner, a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone.[74][75][76]\\nIn 1946, Turing was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by King George VI for his wartime services, but his work remained secret for many years.[77][78]\\nBombe[edit]\\nMain article: Bombe\\nWithin weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park,[65] Turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the bombe, which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba kryptologiczna, from which its name was derived. The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman, became one of the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages.[79]\\nA complete and working replica of a bombe now at The National Museum of Computing on Bletchley ParkThe bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message (i.e., rotor order, rotor settings and plugboard settings) using a suitable crib: a fragment of probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors (which had on the order of 1019 states, or 1022 states for the four-rotor U-boat variant),[80] the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented electromechanically.[citation needed]\\nThe bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter, which was impossible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.[81]\\nBy late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner-Barry were frustrated. Building on the work of the Poles, they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals, but their limited staff and bombes meant they could not translate all the signals. In the summer, they had considerable success, and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month; however, they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels, but had failed.[82]\\nOn 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill explaining their difficulties, with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces.[82] As Andrew Hodges, biographer of Turing, later wrote, \"This letter had an electric effect.\"[83] Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay, which read: \"ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done.\" On 18 November, the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken.[83] The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister\\'s response, but as Milner-Barry recalled, \"All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth.\"[84] More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war.[85]\\nStatue of Turing by Stephen Kettle at Bletchley Park, commissioned by Sidney Frank, built from half a million pieces of Welsh slate.[86]\\nHut 8 and the naval Enigma[edit]\\nTuring decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma \"because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself\".[87] In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services.[87][88]\\nThat same night, he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus, a sequential statistical technique (what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis) to assist in breaking the naval Enigma, \"though I was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not, in fact, sure until some days had actually broken.\"[87] For this, he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the ban. Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors, substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes.[89] Later this sequential process of accumulating sufficient weight of evidence using decibans (one tenth of a ban) was used in Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher[90]\\nTuring travelled to the United States in November 1942[91] and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington; he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio.\\nTuring\\'s reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic:\\nThe American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme, but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way.\\nTheir test (of commutators) can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it.[92]\\nDuring this trip, he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices.[93] He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence, Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8, although Alexander had been de facto head for some time (Turing having little interest in the day-to-day running of the section). Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.[94]\\nAlexander wrote of Turing\\'s contribution:\\nThere should be no question in anyone\\'s mind that Turing\\'s work was the biggest factor in Hut 8\\'s success. In the early days, he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hut, but he also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief credit for the invention of the bombe. It is always difficult to say that anyone is \\'absolutely indispensable\\', but if anyone was indispensable to Hut 8, it was Turing. The pioneer\\'s work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the magnitude of Turing\\'s contribution was never fully realised by the outside world.[95]\\nTuringery[edit]\\nIn July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed Turingery (or jokingly Turingismus)[96] for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans\\' new Geheimschreiber (secret writer) machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel-breaking, i.e., a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny\\'s wheels.[97] He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who, under the guidance of Max Newman, went on to build the Colossus computer, the world\\'s first programmable digital electronic computer, which replaced a simpler prior machine (the Heath Robinson), and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages.[98] Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher,[99][100] but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development.[101]\\nDelilah[edit]\\nFollowing his work at Bell Labs in the US,[102] Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system. In the latter part of the war, he moved in order to work for the Secret Service\\'s Radio Security Service (later HMGCC) at Hanslope Park. At the park, he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah.[103] The machine was intended for different applications, but it lacked the capability for use with long-distance radio transmissions. In any case, Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully, with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech, Delilah was not adopted for use.[104] Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY, a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war.\\nEarly computers and the Turing test[edit]\\nPlaque, 78 High Street, Hampton\\nBetween 1945 and 1947, Turing lived in Hampton, London,[105] while he worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a stored-program computer.[106] Von Neumann\\'s incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing\\'s paper, but it was much less detailed and, according to John R. Womersley, Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division, it \"contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing\\'s own\".[107] Although ACE was a feasible design, the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.[108] While he was at Cambridge, the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950, and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it, including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G-15. The full version of Turing\\'s ACE was not built until after his death.[109]\\nAccording to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics, published by Genscher, Düsseldorf, there was a meeting between Turing and Konrad Zuse.[110] It took place in Göttingen in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley, Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing (for more details see Herbert Bruderer, Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz).\\nIn 1948, Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. A year later, he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers—the Manchester Mark 1. Turing wrote the first version of the Programmer\\'s Manual for this machine, and was recruited by Ferranti as a consultant in the development of their commercialised machine, the Ferranti Mark 1. He continued to be paid consultancy fees by Ferranti until his death.[111] During this time, he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics,[112] and in \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" (Mind, October 1950), Turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence, and proposed an experiment that became known as the Turing test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called \"intelligent\". The idea was that a computer could be said to \"think\" if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being.[113] In the paper, Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind, it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child\\'s mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet; the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer.\\nIn 1948 Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, D.G. Champernowne, began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950, the program was completed and dubbed the Turbochamp.[114] In 1952, he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1, but lacking enough power, the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead, Turing \"ran\" the program by flipping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on a chessboard, taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded.[115]\\nAccording to Garry Kasparov, Turing\\'s program \"played a recognizable game of chess.\"[116] The program lost to Turing\\'s colleague Alick Glennie, although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne\\'s wife,\\nIsabel.[117]\\nHis Turing test was a significant, characteristically provocative, and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence, which continues after more than half a century.[118]\\nPattern formation and mathematical biology[edit]\\nWhen Turing was 39 years old in 1951, he turned to mathematical biology, finally publishing his masterpiece \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\" in January 1952. He was interested in morphogenesis, the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. Among other things, he wanted to understand Fibonacci phyllotaxis, the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures.[119] He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space, termed a reaction-diffusion system, could account for \"the main phenomena of morphogenesis\".[120] He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example, if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place, and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A, then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic, and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A, but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates, then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. To calculate the extent of this, Turing would have needed a powerful computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951, so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand. These calculations gave the right qualitative results, and produced, for example, a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results, but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics. Belousov was not aware of Turing\\'s paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.[121]\\nAlthough published before the structure and role of DNA was understood, Turing\\'s work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology.[122] One of the early applications of Turing\\'s paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats, large and small.[123][124][125] Further research in the area suggests that Turing\\'s work can partially explain the growth of \"feathers, hair follicles, the branching pattern of lungs, and even the left-right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest.\"[126] In 2012, Sheth, et al. found that in mice, removal of Hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb, suggesting that Hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a Turing-type mechanism.[127] Later papers were not available until Collected Works of A.\\xa0M.\\xa0Turing was published in 1992.[128]\\nPersonal life[edit]\\nIn 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly \"unfazed\" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.[129]\\nConviction for indecency[edit]\\nIn January 1952, Turing was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Just before Christmas, Turing was walking along Manchester\\'s Oxford Road when he met Murray just outside the Regal Cinema and invited him to lunch. On 23 January, Turing\\'s house was burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time,[130] and both men were charged with \"gross indecency\" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885.[131] Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing\\'s solicitor \"reserved his defence\", i.e., did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations.\\nTuring was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, and he entered a plea of guilty.[132] The case, Regina v. Turing and Murray, was brought to trial on 31 March 1952.[133] Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation. His probation would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal physical changes designed to reduce libido. He accepted the option of injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES), a synthetic oestrogen; this feminization of his body was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused breast tissue to form,[134] fulfilling in the literal sense Turing\\'s prediction that \"no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I\\'ve not found out\".[135][136] Murray was given a conditional discharge.[137]\\nTuring\\'s conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC&CS in 1946, though he kept his academic job. He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other European countries. Turing was never accused of espionage but, in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park, he was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work.[138]\\nDeath[edit]\\nOn 8 June 1954, Turing\\'s housekeeper found him dead; he had died the previous day. Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death.[139] When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,[140] it was speculated that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide. Andrew Hodges and another biographer, David Leavitt, have both speculated that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), his favourite fairy tale. Both men noted that (in Leavitt\\'s words) he took \"an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew.\"[141] Turing\\'s remains were cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954[142] and his ashes were scattered in the gardens of the crematorium, just as his father\\'s had been.[143]\\nPhilosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner\\'s historical verdict. He suggested an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing\\'s death: the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus used to electroplate gold onto spoons. The potassium cyanide was used to dissolve the gold. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland noted that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before going to bed, and it was not unusual for the apple to be discarded half-eaten.[144] In addition, Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment (which had been discontinued a year previously) \"with good humour\" and had shown no sign of despondency prior to his death. He even set down a list of tasks that he intended to complete upon returning to his office after the holiday weekend.[144] Turing\\'s mother believed that the ingestion was accidental, resulting from her son\\'s careless storage of laboratory chemicals.[145] Biographer Andrew Hodges theorised that Turing arranged the delivery of the equipment in order to deliberately allow his mother plausible deniability in regard to any suicide claims.[146]\\nTuring\\'s OBE currently held in Sherborne School archives\\nConspiracy theorists pointed out that Turing was the cause of intense anxiety to the British authorities at the time of his death. The secret services feared that communists would entrap prominent homosexuals and use them to gather intelligence. Turing was still engaged in highly classified work when he was also a practising homosexual who holidayed in European countries near the Iron Curtain. It is possible that the secret services considered him too great a security risk and assassinated one of the most brilliant minds in their employ.[147]\\nTuring believed in extrasensory perception,[148][149][clarification needed] and it has been suggested that his belief in fortune-telling may have caused his depressed mood. As a youth, Turing had been told by a gypsy fortune-teller that he would be a genius.[143] Shortly before his death, during a day-trip to St Annes-on Sea with the Greenbaum family,[when?] Turing again decided to consult a fortune-teller.[143] According to the Greenbaums\\' daughter, Barbara:But it was a lovely sunny day and Alan was in a cheerful mood and off we went... Then he thought it would be a good idea to go to the Pleasure Beach at Blackpool. We found a fortune-teller\\'s tent and Alan said he\\'d like to go in so we waited around for him to come back... And this sunny, cheerful visage had shrunk into a pale, shaking, horror-stricken face. Something had happened. We don\\'t know what the fortune-teller said but he obviously was deeply unhappy. I think that was probably the last time we saw him before we heard of his suicide.\"[150]\\nGovernment apology and pardon[edit]\\nIn August 2009, British programmer John Graham-Cumming started a petition urging the British government to apologise for Turing\\'s prosecution as a homosexual.[151][152] The petition received more than 30,000 signatures.[153][154] The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, acknowledged the petition, releasing a statement on 10 September 2009 apologising and describing the treatment of Turing as \"appalling\":[153][155]\\nThousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated. While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can\\'t put the clock back, his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him\\xa0... So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan\\'s work I am very proud to say: we\\'re sorry, you deserved so much better.[153][156]\\nIn December 2011, William Jones created an e-petition[157] requesting that the British government pardon Turing for his conviction of \"gross indecency\":[158]\\nWe ask the HM Government to grant a pardon to Alan Turing for the conviction of \"gross indecency\". In 1952, he was convicted of \"gross indecency\" with another man and was forced to undergo so-called \"organo-therapy\"—chemical castration. Two years later, he killed himself with cyanide, aged just 41. Alan Turing was driven to a terrible despair and early death by the nation he\\'d done so much to save. This remains a shame on the British government and British history. A pardon can go some way to healing this damage. It may act as an apology to many of the other gay men, not as well-known as Alan Turing, who were subjected to these laws.[157]\\nThe petition gathered over 37,000 signatures,[18][157] and was supported by Manchester MP John Leech but the request was discouraged by Justice Minister Lord McNally, who said:[159]\\nA posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as Alan Turing was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence. He would have known that his offence was against the law and that he would be prosecuted. It is tragic that Alan Turing was convicted of an offence that now seems both cruel and absurd—particularly poignant given his outstanding contribution to the war effort. However, the law at the time required a prosecution and, as such, long-standing policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and, rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right, ensure instead that we never again return to those times.[160]\\nJohn Leech, the MP for Manchester Withington (2005–15), submitted several bills to Parliament[161] and campaigned with Jones to secure the pardon. Leech made the case in the House of Commons that Turing\\'s contribution to the war made him a national hero and that it was \"ultimately just embarrassing\" that the conviction still stood.[162] Leech continued to take the bill through Parliament and campaigned for several years until it was passed.[163]\\nAt the UK premiere of a film based on Turing\\'s life, The Imitation Game, the producers thanked Leech for bringing the topic to public attention and securing Turing\\'s pardon.[164] His campaign turned to acquiring pardons for the 75,000 other men convicted of the same crime. Leech\\'s campaign gained public support from leading scientists, including Stephen Hawking.[165]\\nOn 26 July 2012, a bill was introduced in the House of Lords to grant a statutory pardon to Turing for offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, of which he was convicted on 31 March 1952.[166] Late in the year in a letter to The Daily Telegraph, the physicist Stephen Hawking and 10 other signatories including the Astronomer Royal Lord Rees, President of the Royal Society Sir Paul Nurse, Lady Trumpington (who worked for Turing during the war) and Lord Sharkey (the bill\\'s sponsor) called on Prime Minister David Cameron to act on the pardon request.[167] The government indicated it would support the bill,[168][169][170] and it passed its third reading in the Lords in October.[171]\\nAt the bill\\'s second reading in the House of Commons on 29 November 2013, Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to the bill, delaying its passage. The bill was due to return to the House of Commons on 28 February 2014,[172] but before the bill could be debated in the House of Commons,[173] the government elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy. On 24 December 2013, Queen Elizabeth II signed a pardon for Turing\\'s conviction for \"gross indecency\", with immediate effect.[17] Announcing the pardon, Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling said Turing deserved to be \"remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort\" and not for his later criminal conviction.[16][18] The Queen officially pronounced Turing pardoned in August 2014.[174] The Queen\\'s action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the Second World War.[175] Pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent, and a request has been made by the family or other interested party; neither condition was met in regard to Turing\\'s conviction.[176]\\nIn a letter to the Prime Minister, David Cameron, human rights advocate Peter Tatchell criticised the decision to single out Turing due to his fame and achievements when thousands of others convicted under the same law have not received pardons.[177] Tatchell also called for a new investigation into Turing\\'s death:\\nA new inquiry is long overdue, even if only to dispel any doubts about the true cause of his death—including speculation that he was murdered by the security services (or others). I think murder by state agents is unlikely. There is no known evidence pointing to any such act. However, it is a major failing that this possibility has never been considered or investigated.[178]\\nIn September 2016, the government announced its intention to expand this retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical indecency offences, in what was described as an \"Alan Turing law\".[179][180] The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for the law in the United Kingdom, contained in the Policing and Crime Act 2017, which serves as an amnesty law to retroactively pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. The law applies in England and Wales.[181]\\nAwards, honours, and tributes[edit]\\nThe Alan Turing Building at the University of Manchester in 2008\\nTuring was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire 1946.[78] He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1951.[7] Several things are named in his honour:\\nAlan Turing Institute\\nChurch–Turing thesis\\nGood–Turing frequency estimation\\nTuring completeness\\nTuring degree\\nTuring fixed-point combinator\\nTuring Institute\\nTuring Lecture\\nTuring machine\\nTuring patterns\\nTuring reduction\\nTuring switch\\nTuring test\\nPosthumous tributes[edit]\\nVarious institutions have paid tribute to Turing by naming things after him including:\\nThe computer room at King\\'s College, Cambridge, Turing\\'s alma mater, is called the Turing Room.[182]\\nThe Turing Room at the University of Edinburgh\\'s School of Informatics houses a bust of Turing by Eduardo Paolozzi, and a set (No. 42/50) of his Turing prints (2000).[183]\\nThe University of Surrey has a statue of Turing on their main piazza[184] and one of the buildings of Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences is named after him.[185]\\nIstanbul Bilgi University organises an annual conference on the theory of computation called \"Turing Days\".[186]\\nThe University of Texas at Austin has an honours computer science programme named the Turing Scholars.[187]\\nIn the early 1960s, Stanford University named the sole lecture room of the Polya Hall Mathematics building \"Alan Turing Auditorium\".[188]\\nOne of the amphitheatres of the Computer Science department (LIFL[189]) at the University of Lille in northern France is named in honour of Alan M.

For his work at the Foreign Office he was awarded the OBE.[7]\\nSince 1966, the Turing Award has been given annually by the Association for Computing Machinery for technical or theoretical contributions to the computing community. It is widely considered to be the computing world\\'s highest honour, equivalent to the Nobel Prize.[206]\\nOn 23 June 1998, on what would have been Turing\\'s 86th birthday, his biographer, Andrew Hodges, unveiled an official English Heritage blue plaque at his birthplace in Warrington Crescent, London, later the Colonnade Hotel.[207][208] To mark the 50th anniversary of his death, a memorial plaque was unveiled on 7 June 2004 at his former residence, Hollymeade, in Wilmslow, Cheshire.[209] A blue plaque marking Turing\\'s home at Wilmslow, Cheshire\\nOn 13 March 2000, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines issued a set of postage stamps to celebrate the greatest achievements of the 20th century, one of which carries a portrait of Turing against a background of repeated 0s and 1s, and is captioned: \"1937: Alan Turing\\'s theory of digital computing\". On 1 April 2003, Turing\\'s work at Bletchley Park was named an IEEE Milestone.[210] On 28 October 2004, a bronze statue of Turing sculpted by John W. Mills was unveiled at the University of Surrey in Guildford, marking the 50th anniversary of Turing\\'s death; it portrays him carrying his books across the campus.[184]\\nTuring was one of four mathematicians examined in the BBC documentary entitled Dangerous Knowledge (2008).[211] The Princeton Alumni Weekly named Turing the second most significant alumnus in the history of Princeton University, second only to President James Madison. A 1.5-ton, life-size statue of Turing was unveiled on 19 June 2007 at Bletchley Park. Built from approximately half a million pieces of Welsh slate, it was sculpted by Stephen Kettle, having been commissioned by the American billionaire Sidney Frank.[212]\\nTuring has been honoured in various ways in Manchester, the city where he worked towards the end of his life. In 1994, a stretch of the A6010 road (the Manchester city intermediate ring road) was named \"Alan Turing Way\". A bridge carrying this road was widened, and carries the name Alan Turing Bridge. A statue of Turing was unveiled in Manchester on 23 June 2001 in Sackville Park, between the University of Manchester building on Whitworth Street and Canal Street. The memorial statue depicts the \"father of computer science\" sitting on a bench at a central position in the park. Turing is shown holding an apple. The cast bronze bench carries in relief the text \\'Alan Mathison Turing 1912–1954\\', and the motto \\'Founder of Computer Science\\' as it could appear if encoded by an Enigma machine: \\'IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ\\'. However, the meaning of the coded message is disputed, as the \\'u\\' in \\'computer\\' matches up with the \\'u\\' in \\'ADXUO\\'. As a letter encoded by an enigma machine can not appear as itself, the actual message behind the code is uncertain.[213]\\nTuring memorial statue plaque in Sackville Park, Manchester\\nA plaque at the statue\\'s feet reads \\'Father of computer science, mathematician, logician, wartime codebreaker, victim of prejudice\\'. There is also a Bertrand Russell quotation: \"Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture.\" The sculptor buried his own old Amstrad computer under the plinth as a tribute to \"the godfather of all modern computers\".[214]\\nIn 1999, Time magazine named Turing as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century and stated, \"The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine.\"[8]\\nIn 2002, Turing was ranked twenty-first on the BBC\\'s poll of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote.[215] In 2006, British writer and mathematician Ioan James chose Turing as one of twenty people to feature in his book about famous historical figures who may have had some of the traits of Asperger syndrome.[216] In 2010, actor/playwright Jade Esteban Estrada portrayed Turing in the solo musical, Icons: The Lesbian and Gay History of the World, Vol. 4. In 2011, in The Guardian\\'s \"My hero\" series, writer Alan Garner chose Turing as his hero and described how they had met while out jogging in the early 1950s. Garner remembered Turing as \"funny and witty\" and said that he \"talked endlessly\".[217] In 2006, Turing was named with online resources as an LGBT History Month Icon.[218] In 2006, Boston Pride named Turing their Honorary Grand Marshal.[219]\\nTuring memorial statue in Sackville Park, Manchester\\nThe logo of Apple Inc. is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to Turing, with the bite mark a reference to his death.[220] Both the designer of the logo[221] and the company deny that there is any homage to Turing in the design.[222][223] Stephen Fry has recounted asking Steve Jobs whether the design was intentional, saying that Jobs\\' response was, \"God, we wish it were.\"[224] In February 2011, Turing\\'s papers from the Second World War were bought for the nation with an 11th-hour bid by the National Heritage Memorial Fund, allowing them to stay at Bletchley Park.[225]\\nIn 2012, Turing was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display that celebrates LGBT history and people.[226][227]\\nThe song \"Alan et la Pomme\", by francophone singer-songwriter Salvatore Adamo, is a tribute to Turing.[228] Turing\\'s life and work featured in a BBC children\\'s programme about famous scientists, Absolute Genius with Dick and Dom, first broadcast on 12 March 2014.\\nOn 17 May 2014, the world\\'s first work of public art to recognise Turing as gay was commissioned in Bletchley, close by to Bletchley Park where his war-time work was carried out.

The work was unveiled at a ceremony on Turing\\'s birthday, 23 June 2014, and is placed alongside busy Watling Street, the old main road to London, where Turing himself would have passed by on many occasions. On 22 October 2014, Turing was inducted into the NSA Hall of Honor.[229][230]\\nIn February 2019, in the BBC eight-part series Icons: The Greatest Person of the 20th Century, Turing was voted by viewers to be the Greatest Person.[231]\\nCentenary celebrations[edit]\\nMain article: Alan Turing Year\\nDavid Chalmers on stage for an Alan Turing Year conference at De La Salle University, Manila, 27 March 2012\\nTo mark the 100th anniversary of Turing\\'s birth, the Turing Centenary Advisory Committee (TCAC) co-ordinated the Alan Turing Year, a year-long programme of events around the world honouring Turing\\'s life and achievements.

W. LeibnizLéon BrunschvicgAlexis de TocquevilleHenri Bergson\\nBlaise Pascal (/pæˈskæl, pɑːˈskɑːl/;[3] French:\\xa0[blɛz paskal]; 19 June 1623 – 19 August 1662) was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, writer and Catholic theologian. He was a child prodigy who was educated by his father, a tax collector in Rouen. Pascal\\'s earliest work was in the natural and applied sciences where he made important contributions to the study of fluids, and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalising the work of Evangelista Torricelli. Pascal also wrote in defence of the scientific method.\\nIn 1642, while still a teenager, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines. After three years of effort and 50 prototypes,[4] he built 20 finished machines (called Pascal\\'s calculators and later Pascalines) over the following 10 years,[5] establishing him as one of the first two inventors of the mechanical calculator.[6][7]\\nPascal was an important mathematician, helping create two major new areas of research: he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of 16, and later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory, strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science. Following Galileo Galilei and Torricelli, in 1647, he rebutted Aristotle\\'s followers who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum. Pascal\\'s results caused many disputes before being accepted.\\nIn 1646, he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within Catholicism known by its detractors as Jansenism.[8] Following a religious experience in late 1654, he began writing influential works on philosophy and theology. His two most famous works date from this period: the Lettres provinciales and the Pensées, the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and Jesuits. In that year, he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle. Between 1658 and 1659, he wrote on the cycloid and its use in calculating the volume of solids.\\nThroughout his life, Pascal was in frail health, especially after the age of 18; he died just two months after his 39th birthday.[9]\\nContents\\n1 Early life and education\\n2 Contributions to mathematics\\n2.1 Philosophy of mathematics\\n3 Contributions to the physical sciences\\n4 Adult life, religion, philosophy, and literature\\n4.1 Religious conversion\\n4.2 Brush with death\\n4.3 The Provincial Letters\\n4.4 The Pensées\\n4.5 Last works and death\\n5 Legacy\\n6 Works\\n7 See also\\n8 References\\n9 Further reading\\n10 External links\\nEarly life and education\\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

He lost his mother, Antoinette Begon, at the age of three.[10] His father, Étienne Pascal (1588–1651), who also had an interest in science and mathematics, was a local judge and member of the \"Noblesse de Robe\". Pascal had two sisters, the younger Jacqueline and the elder Gilberte.\\nIn 1631, five years after the death of his wife,[2] Étienne Pascal moved with his children to Paris. The newly arrived family soon hired Louise Delfault, a maid who eventually became an instrumental member of the family. Étienne, who never remarried, decided that he alone would educate his children, for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability, particularly his son Blaise. The young Pascal showed an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science.\\nPortrait of Pascal\\nParticularly of interest to Pascal was a work of Desargues on conic sections. Following Desargues\\' thinking, the 16-year-old Pascal produced, as a means of proof, a short treatise on what was called the \"Mystic Hexagram\", Essai pour les coniques (\"Essay on Conics\") and sent it—his first serious work of mathematics—to Père Mersenne in Paris; it is known still today as Pascal\\'s theorem. It states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle (or conic) then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line (called the Pascal line).\\nPascal\\'s work was so precocious that Descartes was convinced that Pascal\\'s father had written it. When assured by Mersenne that it was, indeed, the product of the son and not the father, Descartes dismissed it with a sniff: \"I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients,\" adding, \"but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a 16-year-old child.\"[11]\\nIn France at that time offices and positions could be—and were—bought and sold. In 1631, Étienne sold his position as second president of the Cour des Aides for 65,665 livres.[12] The money was invested in a government bond which provided, if not a lavish, then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the Pascal family to move to, and enjoy, Paris. But in 1638 Richelieu, desperate for money to carry on the Thirty Years\\' War, defaulted on the government\\'s bonds. Suddenly Étienne Pascal\\'s worth had dropped from nearly 66,000 livres to less than 7,300.\\nAn early Pascaline on display at the Musée des Arts et Métiers, Paris\\nLike so many others, Étienne was eventually forced to flee Paris because of his opposition to the fiscal policies of Cardinal Richelieu, leaving his three children in the care of his neighbour Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children\\'s play with Richelieu in attendance that Étienne was pardoned. In time, Étienne was back in good graces with the cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the king\\'s commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouen—a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.\\nIn 1642, in an effort to ease his father\\'s endless, exhausting calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid (into which work the young Pascal had been recruited), Pascal, not yet 19, constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called Pascal\\'s calculator or the Pascaline. Of the eight Pascalines known to have survived, four are held by the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris and one more by the Zwinger museum in Dresden, Germany, exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators.[13] Although these machines are pioneering forerunners to a further 400 years of development of mechanical methods of calculation, and in a sense to the later field of computer engineering, the calculator failed to be a great commercial success. Partly because it was still quite cumbersome to use in practice, but probably primarily because it was extraordinarily expensive, the Pascaline became little more than a toy, and a status symbol, for the very rich both in France and elsewhere in Europe. Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade, and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design.\\nContributions to mathematics\\nPascal\\'s triangle. Each number is the sum of the two directly above it. The triangle demonstrates many mathematical properties in addition to showing binomial coefficients.\\nPascal continued to influence mathematics throughout his life. His Traité du triangle arithmétique (\"Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle\") of 1653 described a convenient tabular presentation for binomial coefficients, now called Pascal\\'s triangle. The triangle can also be represented:\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n2\\n1\\n3\\n6\\n10\\n15\\n3\\n1\\n4\\n10\\n20\\n4\\n1\\n5\\n15\\n5\\n1\\n6\\n6\\n1\\nHe defines the numbers in the triangle by recursion: Call the number in the (m\\xa0+\\xa01)th row and (n\\xa0+\\xa01)th column tmn. Then tmn\\xa0=\\xa0tm–1,n\\xa0+\\xa0tm,n–1, for m\\xa0=\\xa00,\\xa01,\\xa02,\\xa0... and n\\xa0=\\xa00,\\xa01,\\xa02,\\xa0...\\nThe boundary conditions are tm,−1\\xa0=\\xa00, t−1,n\\xa0=\\xa00 for m\\xa0=\\xa01,\\xa02,\\xa03,\\xa0... and n\\xa0=\\xa01,\\xa02,\\xa03,\\xa0...\\nThe generator t00\\xa0=\\xa01.\\nPascal concludes with the proof,\\nt\\nm\\nn\\n=\\n(\\nm\\n+\\nn\\n)\\n(\\nm\\n+\\nn\\n−\\n1\\n)\\n⋯\\n(\\nm\\n+\\n1\\n)\\nn\\n(\\nn\\n−\\n1\\n)\\n⋯\\n1\\n.\\n{\\\\displaystyle t_{mn}={\\\\frac {(m+n)(m+n-1)\\\\cdots (m+1)}{n(n-1)\\\\cdots 1}}.}\\nIn 1654, he proved Pascal\\'s identity relating the sums of the p-th powers of the first n positive integers for p = 0, 1, 2, ..., k.[14]\\nIn 1654, prompted by his friend the Chevalier de Méré, he corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on the subject of gambling problems, and from that collaboration was born the mathematical theory of probabilities.[15] The specific problem was that of two players who want to finish a game early and, given the current circumstances of the game, want to divide the stakes fairly, based on the chance each has of winning the game from that point. From this discussion, the notion of expected value was introduced. Pascal later (in the Pensées) used a probabilistic argument, Pascal\\'s Wager, to justify belief in God and a virtuous life. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for Leibniz\\' formulation of the calculus.[16]\\nAfter a religious experience in 1654, Pascal mostly gave up work in mathematics.\\nPhilosophy of mathematics\\nPascal\\'s major contribution to the philosophy of mathematics came with his De l\\'Esprit géométrique (\"Of the Geometrical Spirit\"), originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous \"Petites-Ecoles de Port-Royal\" (\"Little Schools of Port-Royal\"). The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths. At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up—first principles, therefore, cannot be reached. Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true.\\nPascal also used De l\\'Esprit géométrique to develop a theory of definition. He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent. The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of essentialism. Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics, arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of formalism as formulated by Descartes.\\nIn De l\\'Art de persuader (\"On the Art of Persuasion\"), Pascal looked deeper into geometry\\'s axiomatic method, specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the axioms upon which later conclusions are based. Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths.\\nContributions to the physical sciences\\nAn illustration of the (apocryphal) Pascal\\'s barrel experiment\\nPascal\\'s work in the fields of the study of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the hydraulic press (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the syringe. He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as Pascal\\'s barrel experiment.\\nBy 1647, Pascal had learned of Evangelista Torricelli\\'s experimentation with barometers. Having replicated an experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube. At the time, most scientists contended that, rather than a vacuum, some invisible matter was present. This was based on the Aristotelian notion that creation was a thing of substance, whether visible or invisible; and that this substance was forever in motion. Furthermore, \"Everything that is in motion must be moved by something,\" Aristotle declared.[17] Therefore, to the Aristotelian trained scientists of Pascal\\'s time, a vacuum was an impossibility. How so? As proof it was pointed out:\\nLight passed through the so-called \"vacuum\" in the glass tube.\\nAristotle wrote how everything moved, and must be moved by something.\\nTherefore, since there had to be an invisible \"something\" to move the light through the glass tube, there was no vacuum in the tube. Not in the glass tube or anywhere else. Vacuums – the absence of any and everything – were simply an impossibility.\\nFollowing more experimentation in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide (\"New experiments with the vacuum\"), which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube. This work was followed by Récit de la grande expérience de l\\'équilibre des liqueurs (\"Account of the great experiment on equilibrium in liquids\") published in 1648.\\nThe Torricellian vacuum found that air pressure is equal to the weight of 30 inches of mercury. If air has a finite weight, Earth\\'s atmosphere must have a maximum height. Pascal reasoned that if true, air pressure on a high mountain must be less than at a lower altitude. He lived near the Puy de Dôme mountain, 4,790 feet (1,460\\xa0m) tall, but his health was poor so could not climb it.[18] On 19 September 1648, after many months of Pascal\\'s friendly but insistent prodding, Florin Périer, husband of Pascal\\'s elder sister Gilberte, was finally able to carry out the fact-finding mission vital to Pascal\\'s theory. The account, written by Périer, reads:\\n.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}The weather was chancy last Saturday...[but] around five o\\'clock that morning...the Puy-de-Dôme was visible...so I decided to give it a try. Several important people of the city of Clermont had asked me to let them know when I would make the ascent...I was delighted to have them with me in this great work...\\n...at eight o\\'clock we met in the gardens of the Minim Fathers, which has the lowest elevation in town....First I poured 16 pounds of quicksilver...into a vessel...then took several glass tubes...each four feet long and hermetically sealed at one end and opened at the other...then placed them in the vessel [of quicksilver]...I found the quick silver stood at 26\" and 3\\u200b1⁄2 lines above the quicksilver in the vessel...I repeated the experiment two more times while standing in the same spot...[they] produced the same result each time...\\nI attached one of the tubes to the vessel and marked the height of the quicksilver and...asked Father Chastin, one of the Minim Brothers...to watch if any changes should occur through the day...Taking the other tube and a portion of the quick silver...I walked to the top of Puy-de-Dôme, about 500 fathoms higher than the monastery, where upon experiment...found that the quicksilver reached a height of only 23\" and 2 lines...I repeated the experiment five times with care...each at different points on the summit...found the same height of quicksilver...in each case...[19]\\nPascal replicated the experiment in Paris by carrying a barometer up to the top of the bell tower at the church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, a height of about 50 metres. The mercury dropped two lines.\\nIn the face of criticism that some invisible matter must exist in Pascal\\'s empty space, Pascal, in his reply to Estienne Noel, gave one of the 17th century\\'s major statements on the scientific method, which is a striking anticipation of the idea popularised by Karl Popper that scientific theories are characterised by their falsifiability: \"In order to show that a hypothesis is evident, it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it; instead, if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena, that suffices to establish its falsity.\"[20] His insistence on the existence of the vacuum also led to conflict with other prominent scientists, including Descartes.\\nPascal introduced a primitive form of roulette and the roulette wheel in his search for a perpetual motion machine.[21]\\nAdult life, religion, philosophy, and literature\\nPart of a series onCatholic philosophyAquinas, Scotus, and Ockham\\nEthics\\nNatural law\\nPersonalism\\nSocial teaching\\nVirtue ethics\\nSchools\\nAugustinianism\\nMolinism\\nOccamism\\nSalamanca\\nScholasticism\\nNeo-scholasticism\\nScotism\\nThomism\\nPhilosophers\\nAntiquity\\nAmbrose\\nAthanasius the Great\\nAugustine of Hippo\\nCyprian of Carthage\\nGregory of Nyssa\\nIgnatius of Antioch\\nIrenaeus of Lyons\\nJerome\\nJohn Chrysostom\\nJohn of Damascus\\nJustin Martyr\\nOrigen\\nPaul the Apostle\\nTertullian\\nMedieval\\nBoethius\\nIsidore of Seville\\nScotus Eriugena\\nBede\\nAnselm of Canterbury\\nHildegard of Bingen\\nPeter Abelard\\nBernard of Clairvaux\\nHugh of Saint Victor\\nThomas Aquinas\\nBenedict of Nursia\\nPope Gregory I\\nPeter Lombard\\nBonaventure\\nAlbertus Magnus\\nDuns Scotus\\nRoger Bacon\\nGiles of Rome\\nJames of Viterbo\\nGregory of Rimini\\nWilliam of Ockham\\nCatherine of Siena\\nPaul of Venice\\nRenaissance and Modern\\nBaltasar Gracián\\nNicholas of Cusa\\nLuis de Molina\\nTeresa of Ávila\\nThomas More\\nFrancis de Sales\\nFrancisco de Vitoria\\nDomingo de Soto\\nMartín de Azpilcueta\\nTomás de Mercado\\nPope Benedict XIV\\nAntoine Arnauld\\nRobert Bellarmine\\nRené Descartes\\nFrançois Fénelon\\nPierre Gassendi\\nAlphonsus Liguori\\nNicolas Malebranche\\nBlaise Pascal\\nFrancisco Suarez\\nGiovanni Botero\\nContemporary\\nPope Benedict XVI\\nPope John Paul II\\nMortimer J.

A nothing in relation to infinity, all in relation to nothing, a central point between nothing and all and infinitely far from understanding either. The ends of things and their beginnings are impregnably concealed from him in an impenetrable secret. He is equally incapable of seeing the nothingness out of which he was drawn and the infinite in which he is engulfed.\\nBlaise Pascal, Pensées No. 72\\nReligious conversion\\nPascal studying the cycloid, by Augustin Pajou, 1785, Louvre\\nIn the winter of 1646, Pascal\\'s 58-year-old father broke his hip when he slipped and fell on an icy street of Rouen; given the man\\'s age and the state of medicine in the 17th century, a broken hip could be a very serious condition, perhaps even fatal. Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France: Monsieur Doctor Deslandes and Monsieur Doctor de La Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal \"would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice, for the old man survived and was able to walk again...\"[22] But treatment and rehabilitation took three months, during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes had become regular visitors.\\nBoth men were followers of Jean Guillebert, proponent of a splinter group from Catholic teaching known as Jansenism. This still fairly small sect was making surprising inroads into the French Catholic community at that time. It espoused rigorous Augustinism. Blaise spoke with the doctors frequently, and after their successful treatment of his father, borrowed from them works by Jansenist authors. In this period, Pascal experienced a sort of \"first conversion\" and began to write on theological subjects in the course of the following year.\\nPascal fell away from this initial religious engagement and experienced a few years of what some biographers have called his \"worldly period\" (1648–54). His father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to Pascal and his sister Jacqueline, for whom Pascal acted as conservator. Jacqueline announced that she would soon become a postulant in the Jansenist convent of Port-Royal. Pascal was deeply affected and very sad, not because of her choice, but because of his chronic poor health; he needed her just as she had needed him.\\nSuddenly there was war in the Pascal household. Blaise pleaded with Jacqueline not to leave, but she was adamant. He commanded her to stay, but that didn\\'t work, either. At the heart of this was...Blaise\\'s fear of abandonment...if Jacqueline entered Port-Royal, she would have to leave her inheritance behind...[but] nothing would change her mind.[23]\\nBy the end of October in 1651, a truce had been reached between brother and sister. In return for a healthy annual stipend, Jacqueline signed over her part of the inheritance to her brother.\\nGilberte had already been given her inheritance in the form of a dowry. In early January, Jacqueline left for Port-Royal. On that day, according to Gilberte concerning her brother, \"He retired very sadly to his rooms without seeing Jacqueline, who was waiting in the little parlor...\"[24]\\nIn early June 1653, after what must have seemed like endless badgering from Jacqueline,\\nPascal formally signed over the whole of his sister\\'s inheritance to Port-Royal, which, to him, \"had begun to smell like a cult.\"[25] With two thirds of his father\\'s estate now gone, the 29-year-old Pascal was now consigned to genteel poverty.\\nFor a while, Pascal pursued the life of a bachelor. During visits to his sister at Port-Royal in 1654, he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God.[26]\\nBrush with death\\nOn 23 November 1654, between 10:30 and 12:30 at night, Pascal had an intense religious vision and immediately recorded the experience in a brief note to himself which began: \"Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and the scholars...\" and concluded by quoting Psalm 119:16: \"I will not forget thy word. Amen.\" He seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death.[27] This piece is now known as the Memorial. The story of the carriage accident[clarification needed] as having led to the experience described in the Memorial is disputed by some scholars.[28]\\nHis belief and religious commitment revitalized, Pascal visited the older of two convents at Port-Royal for a two-week retreat in January 1655. For the next four years, he regularly travelled between Port-Royal and Paris. It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion, the Provincial Letters.\\nThe Provincial Letters\\nMain article: Lettres provinciales\\nFrench literature\\nby category\\nFrench literary history\\nMedieval\\nRenaissance\\n17th\\n18th\\n19th\\n20th century\\nContemporary\\nFrench writers\\nChronological list\\nWriters by category\\nEssayists\\nNovelists\\nPlaywrights\\nPoets\\nShort story writers\\nChildren\\'s writers\\nPortals\\nFrance\\nFrench language\\nLiterature\\nFrench/Francophone literature\\nvte\\nBeginning in 1656–57, Pascal published his memorable attack on casuistry, a popular ethical method used by Catholic thinkers in the early modern period (especially the Jesuits, and in particular Antonio Escobar). Pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of sins. The 18-letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte and incensed Louis XIV. The king ordered that the book be shredded and burnt in 1660. In 1661, in the midsts of the formulary controversy, the Jansenist school at Port-Royal was condemned and closed down; those involved with the school had to sign a 1656 papal bull condemning the teachings of Jansen as heretical. The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied Alexander VII himself. Even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal\\'s arguments.\\nAside from their religious influence, the Provincial Letters were popular as a literary work. Pascal\\'s use of humor, mockery, and vicious satire in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption, and influenced the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\\nCharles Perrault wrote of the Letters: \"Everything is there—purity of language, nobility of thought, solidity in reasoning, finesse in raillery, and throughout an agrément not to be found anywhere else.\"[29]\\nThe Pensées\\nMain article: Pensées\\nPascal\\'s most influential theological work, referred to posthumously as the Pensées (\"Thoughts\"), was not completed before his death. It was to have been a sustained and coherent examination and defense of the Christian faith, with the original title Apologie de la religion Chrétienne (\"Defense of the Christian Religion\"). The first version of the numerous scraps of paper found after his death appeared in print as a book in 1669 titled Pensées de M. Pascal sur la religion, et sur quelques autres sujets (\"Thoughts of M. Pascal on religion, and on some other subjects\") and soon thereafter became a classic. One of the Apologie\\'s main strategies was to use the contradictory philosophies of skepticism and stoicism, personalized by Montaigne on one hand, and Epictetus on the other, in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God.\\nPascal\\'s Pensées is widely considered to be a masterpiece, and a landmark in French prose. When commenting on one particular section (Thought #72), Sainte-Beuve praised it as the finest pages in the French language.[30] Will Durant hailed the Pensées as \"the most eloquent book in French prose\".[31]\\nLast works and death\\nPascal\\'s epitaph in Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, where he was buried\\nT. S. Eliot described him during this phase of his life as \"a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic among men of the world.\" Pascal\\'s ascetic lifestyle derived from a belief that it was natural and necessary for a person to suffer. In 1659, Pascal fell seriously ill. During his last years, he frequently tried to reject the ministrations of his doctors, saying, \"Sickness is the natural state of Christians.\"[32]\\nLouis XIV suppressed the Jansenist movement at Port-Royal in 1661. In response, Pascal wrote one of his final works, Écrit sur la signature du formulaire (\"Writ on the Signing of the Form\"), exhorting the Jansenists not to give in. Later that year, his sister Jacqueline died, which convinced Pascal to cease his polemics on Jansenism. Pascal\\'s last major achievement, returning to his mechanical genius, was inaugurating perhaps the first bus line, the carrosses à cinq sols, moving passengers within Paris in a carriage with many seats.\\nIn 1662, Pascal\\'s illness became more violent, and his emotional condition had severely worsened since his sister\\'s death. Aware that his health was fading quickly, he sought a move to the hospital for incurable diseases, but his doctors declared that he was too unstable to be carried. In Paris on 18 August 1662, Pascal went into convulsions and received extreme unction. He died the next morning, his last words being \"May God never abandon me,\" and was buried in the cemetery of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont.[32]\\nAn autopsy performed after his death revealed grave problems with his stomach and other organs of his abdomen, along with damage to his brain. Despite the autopsy, the cause of his poor health was never precisely determined, though speculation focuses on tuberculosis, stomach cancer, or a combination of the two.[33] The headaches which afflicted Pascal are generally attributed to his brain lesion.\\nLegacy\\nDeath mask of Blaise Pascal.\\nIn honour of his scientific contributions, the name Pascal has been given to the SI unit of pressure, to a programming language, and Pascal\\'s law (an important principle of hydrostatics), and as mentioned above, Pascal\\'s triangle and Pascal\\'s wager still bear his name.\\nPascal\\'s development of probability theory was his most influential contribution to mathematics. Originally applied to gambling, today it is extremely important in economics, especially in actuarial science. John Ross writes, \"Probability theory and the discoveries following it changed the way we regard uncertainty, risk, decision-making, and an individual\\'s and society\\'s ability to influence the course of future events.\"[34] However, it should be noted that Pascal and Fermat, though doing important early work in probability theory, did not develop the field very far. Christiaan Huygens, learning of the subject from the correspondence of Pascal and Fermat, wrote the first book on the subject. Later figures who continued the development of the theory include Abraham de Moivre and Pierre-Simon Laplace.\\nIn literature, Pascal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the French Classical Period and is read today as one of the greatest masters of French prose. His use of satire and wit influenced later polemicists. The content of his literary work is best remembered for its strong opposition to the rationalism of René Descartes and simultaneous assertion that the main countervailing philosophy, empiricism, was also insufficient for determining major truths.\\nIn France, prestigious annual awards, Blaise Pascal Chairs are given to outstanding international scientists to conduct their research in the Ile de France region.[35] One of the Universities of Clermont-Ferrand, France – Université Blaise Pascal – is named after him. The University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, holds an annual math contest named in his honour.[36]\\nPascalian theology has grown out of his perspective that we are, according to Wood, \"born into a duplicitous world that shapes us into duplicitous subjects and so we find it easy to reject God continually and deceive ourselves about our own sinfulness\".[37]\\nRoberto Rossellini directed a filmed biopic, Blaise Pascal, which originally aired on Italian television in 1971.[38] Pascal was a subject of the first edition of the 1984 BBC Two documentary, Sea of Faith, presented by Don Cupitt.\\nIn 2014, Nvidia announced its new Pascal microarchitecture, which is named for Pascal. The first graphics cards featuring Pascal were released in 2016.\\nThe 2017 game Nier: Automata has multiple characters named after famous philosophers; one of these is a sentient pacifistic machine named Pascal, who serves as a major supporting character. Pascal creates a village for machines to live peacefully with the androids they\\'re at war with and acts as a parental figure for other machines trying to adapt to their newly-found individuality.\\nWorks\\nEssai pour les coniques [Essay on conics] (1639)\\nExperiences nouvelles touchant le vide [New experiments with the vacuum] (1647)\\nRécit de la grande expérience de l\\'équilibre des liqueurs [Account of the great experiment on equilibrium in liquids] (1648)\\nTraité du triangle arithmétique [Treatise on the arithmetic triangle] (1653)\\nLettres provinciales [The provincial letters] (1656–57)\\nDe l\\'Esprit géométrique [On the geometrical spirit] (1657 or 1658)\\nÉcrit sur la signature du formulaire (1661)\\nTraité du triangle arithmétique (Treatise on arithmetical triangle) (written c. 1654;[39] publ. 1665)\\nPensées [Thoughts] (incomplete at death; publ. 1670)\\nSee also\\nScientific revolution\\nList of pioneers in computer science\\nList of works by Eugène Guillaume\\nReferences\\n^ Vincent Jullien (ed.), Seventeenth-Century Indivisibles Revisited, Birkhäuser, 2015, p. 188.\\n^ a b O\\'Connor, J.J.; Robertson, E.F.

Although the judges only had 2,500 words on their list, Donald found 4,500 words, winning the contest. As prizes, the school received a new television and enough candy bars for all of his schoolmates to eat.[6][5]\\nEducation[edit]\\nIn 1956, Knuth received\\xa0a scholarship\\xa0to the Case Institute of Technology (now part of Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland, Ohio. He also joined Beta Nu Chapter of the Theta Chi fraternity. While studying physics at the Case Institute of Technology, Knuth was introduced to the IBM 650, one of the early mainframes. After reading the computer\\'s manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school, because he believed he could do it better.[7]\\nIn 1958, Knuth created a program to help his school\\'s basketball team win their games. He assigned \"values\" to players in order to gauge their probability of getting points, a novel approach that Newsweek and CBS Evening News later reported on.[7]\\nKnuth was one of the founding editors of Case Institute\\'s Engineering and Science Review, which won a national award as best technical magazine in 1959.[8] He then switched from physics to mathematics, and in 1960 he received his bachelor of science degree, simultaneously being given a master of science degree by a special award of the faculty who considered his work exceptionally outstanding.[7][9]\\nIn 1963, with mathematician Marshall Hall as his adviser,[2] he earned a PhD in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology.[10]\\nEarly work[edit]\\nAfter receiving his PhD, Knuth joined Caltech\\'s faculty as an assistant professor.[11]\\nHe accepted a commission to write a book on computer programming language compilers. While working on this project, Knuth decided that he could not adequately treat the topic without first developing a fundamental theory of computer programming, which became The Art of Computer Programming. He originally planned to publish this as a single book. As Knuth developed his outline for the book, he concluded that he required six volumes, and then seven, to thoroughly cover the subject. He published the first volume in 1968.[12]\\nJust before publishing the first volume of The Art of Computer Programming, Knuth left Caltech to accept employment with the Institute for Defense Analyses\\' Communications Research Division, then situated on the Princeton University campus, which was performing mathematical research in cryptography to support the National Security Agency.\\nKnuth then left this position[when?] to join the Stanford University faculty, where he is now Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer Science, Emeritus.[13][14]\\nWritings[edit]\\nKnuth is a writer, as well as a computer scientist.[11] Knuth has been called the \"father of the analysis of algorithms\".[15]\\nThe Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP)[edit]\\nMain article: The Art of Computer Programming\\nIn the 1970s, Knuth described computer science as \"a totally new field with no real identity. And the standard of available publications was not that high. A lot of the papers coming out were quite simply wrong.\\xa0... So one of my motivations was to put straight a story that had been very badly told.\"[16] By 2011, the first three volumes and part one of volume four of his series had been published.[17] Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science 2nd ed., which originated with an expansion of the mathematical preliminaries section of Volume 1 of TAoCP, has also been published.\\nBill Gates has praised the difficulty of the subject matter in The Art of Computer Programming, stating, \"If you think you\\'re a really good programmer\\xa0... You should definitely send me a résumé if you can read the whole thing.\"[18]\\nOther works[edit]\\nKnuth is also the author of Surreal Numbers,[19] a mathematical novelette on John Conway\\'s set theory construction of an alternate system of numbers. Instead of simply explaining the subject, the book seeks to show the development of the mathematics. Knuth wanted the book to prepare students for doing original, creative research.\\nIn 1995, Knuth wrote the foreword to the book A=B by Marko Petkovšek, Herbert Wilf and Doron Zeilberger.[20] Knuth is also an occasional contributor of language puzzles to Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics.\\nKnuth has also delved into recreational mathematics.\\nHe contributed articles to the Journal of Recreational Mathematics beginning in the 1960s, and was acknowledged as a major contributor in Joseph Madachy\\'s Mathematics on Vacation.[21]\\nKnuth has also appeared in a number of Numberphile[22] and Computerphile videos on YouTube where he has discussed topics from writing Surreal Numbers to why he doesn\\'t use email.\\nWorks regarding Knuth\\'s religious beliefs[edit]\\nIn addition to his writings on computer science, Knuth, a Lutheran,[23] is also the author of 3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated,[24] in which he examines the Bible by a process of systematic sampling, namely an analysis of chapter 3, verse 16 of each book.\\nEach verse is accompanied by a rendering in calligraphic art, contributed by a group of calligraphers under the leadership of Hermann Zapf. Subsequently, he was invited to give a set of lectures on his 3:16 project, resulting in another book, Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About, where he published the lectures \"God and Computer Science\".\\nOpinion on software patents[edit]\\nAs a member of the academic and scientific community, Knuth is strongly opposed to the policy of granting software patents for trivial solutions that should be obvious, but has expressed more nuanced views for nontrivial solutions such as the interior-point method of linear programming.[25] He has expressed his disagreement directly to both the United States Patent and Trademark Office and European Patent Organisation.[26]\\nComputer Musings[edit]\\nKnuth gives informal lectures a few times a year at Stanford University, which he titled \"Computer Musings\". He was a visiting professor at the Oxford University Department of Computer Science in the United Kingdom until 2017 and an Honorary Fellow of Magdalen College.[27][28]\\nProgramming[edit]\\nDigital typesetting[edit]\\nIn the 1970s the publishers of TAOCP abandoned Monotype in favor of phototypesetting. Knuth became so frustrated with the inability of the latter system to approach the quality of the previous volumes, typeset using the older system, that he took time out to work on digital typesetting and created TeX and Metafont.[29]\\nLiterate programming[edit]\\nWhile developing TeX, Knuth created a new methodology of programming, which he called literate programming, because he believed that programmers should think of programs as works of literature. \"Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.\"[30]\\nKnuth embodied the idea of literate programming in the WEB system. The same WEB source is used to weave a TeX file, and to tangle a Pascal source file. These in their turn produce a readable description of the program and an executable binary respectively. A later iteration of the system, CWEB, replaces Pascal with C.\\nKnuth used WEB to program TeX and METAFONT, and published both programs as books.\\nPersonal life[edit]\\nDonald Knuth married Nancy Jill Carter on 24 June 1961, while he was a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology. They have two children: John Martin Knuth and Jennifer Sierra Knuth.[31]\\nChinese name[edit]\\nKnuth\\'s Chinese name is Gao Dena (simplified Chinese: 高德纳; traditional Chinese: 高德納; pinyin: Gāo dé nà).[32][3] In 1977, he was given this name by Frances Yao, shortly before making a 3-week trip to China.[3][33] In his 1980 volume of The Art of Computer Programming (simplified Chinese: 计算机程序设计艺术; traditional Chinese: 電腦程式設計藝術; pinyin: Jìsuànjī chéngxù shèjì yìshù), Knuth explains that he embraced his Chinese name because he wanted to be known by the growing numbers of computer programmers in China at the time. In 1989, his Chinese name was placed atop the Journal of Computer Science and Technology\\'s header, which Knuth says \"makes me feel close to all Chinese people although I cannot speak your language\".[33]\\nHealth concerns[edit]\\nIn 2006, Knuth was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He underwent surgery in December that year and stated, \"a little bit of radiation therapy\\xa0... as a precaution but the prognosis looks pretty good\", as he reported in his video autobiography.[34]\\nHumor[edit]\\nOne of Knuth\\'s reward checks\\n\"Nested parens\"—Donald Knuth (on Jacob Appelbaum\\'s shirt within the two parentheses), Jacob Appelbaum, and Donald Knuth\\nKnuth used to pay a finder\\'s fee of $2.56 for any typographical errors or mistakes discovered in his books, because \"256 pennies is one hexadecimal dollar\", and $0.32 for \"valuable suggestions\". According to an article in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\'s Technology Review, these Knuth reward checks are \"among computerdom\\'s most prized trophies\". Knuth had to stop sending real checks in 2008 due to bank fraud, and instead now gives each error finder a \"certificate of deposit\" from a publicly listed balance in his fictitious \"Bank of San Serriffe\".[35]\\nHe once warned a correspondent, \"Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.\"[36]\\nKnuth published his first \"scientific\" article in a school magazine in 1957 under the title \"The Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures\". In it, he defined the fundamental unit of length as the thickness of Mad No. 26, and named the fundamental unit of force \"whatmeworry\". Mad published the article in issue No. 33 (June 1957).[37][38]\\nTo demonstrate the concept of recursion, Knuth intentionally referred \"Circular definition\" and \"Definition, circular\" to each other in the index of The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1.\\nThe preface of Concrete Mathematics has the following paragraph:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}When DEK taught Concrete Mathematics at Stanford for the first time, he explained the somewhat strange title by saying that it was his attempt to teach a math course that was hard instead of soft.\\nHe announced that, contrary to the expectations of his colleagues, he was not going to teach the Theory of Aggregates, nor Stone\\'s Embedding Theorem, nor even the Stone–Čech compactification. (Several students from the civil engineering department got up and quietly left the room.)\\nAt the TUG 2010 Conference, Knuth announced a satirical XML-based successor to TeX, titled \"iTeX\" (pronounced\\xa0[iː˨˩˦tɛks˧˥], performed with a bell ringing), which would support features such as arbitrarily scaled irrational units, 3D printing, input from seismographs and heart monitors, animation, and stereophonic sound.[39][40][41]\\nAwards and honors[edit]\\nIn 1971, Knuth was the recipient of the first ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award. He has received various other awards including the Turing Award, the National Medal of Science, the John von Neumann Medal, and the Kyoto Prize.\\nKnuth was elected a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society (DFBCS) in 1980 in recognition of Knuth\\'s contributions to the field of computer science.\\nIn 1990 he was awarded the one-of-a-kind academic title of Professor of The Art of Computer Programming, which has since been revised to Professor Emeritus of The Art of Computer Programming.\\nKnuth was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1975. In 1992, he became an associate of the French Academy of Sciences. Also that year, he retired from regular research and teaching at Stanford University in order to finish The Art of Computer Programming.

Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II but was rejected because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by Howard H. Aiken. In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer.\\nAt Eckert–Mauchly she began developing the compiler. She believed that a programming language based on English was possible.\\nHer compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written for the A-0 System.[2][3][4][5] During her wartime service, she co-authored three papers based on her work on the Harvard Mark 1.\\nIn 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the COBOL language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967 the Navy recalled her to active duty.\\nShe retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the Digital Equipment Corporation, sharing her computing experiences.\\nOwing to her accomplishments and her naval rank, she was sometimes referred to as \"Amazing Grace\".[6][7] The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS\\xa0Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 \"Hopper\" supercomputer at NERSC.[8] During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. A college at Yale University was renamed in her honor.\\nIn 1991, she received the National Medal of Technology. On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.[9]\\nContents\\n1 Early life and education\\n2 Career\\n2.1 World War II\\n2.2 UNIVAC\\n2.3 COBOL\\n2.4 Standards\\n3 Retirement\\n4 Post-retirement\\n5 Anecdotes\\n6 Death\\n7 Dates of rank\\n8 Awards and honors\\n8.1 Military awards\\n8.2 Other awards\\n9 Legacy\\n9.1 Places\\n9.2 Programs\\n9.3 In popular culture\\n9.3.1 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing\\n10 Obituary notices\\n11 See also\\n12 References\\n13 Further reading\\n14 External links\\nEarly life and education[edit]\\nGrace Hopper (As Told By U.S. Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith)\\nProblems playing this file? See media help.\\nHopper was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children. Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of Scottish and Dutch descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church.[10] Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War.[10]:2–3\\nGrace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock).[11] For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey. Hopper was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (her test scores in Latin were too low), but she was admitted the following year.\\nShe graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor\\'s degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master\\'s degree at Yale University in 1930.\\nIn 1934, she earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale[12] under the direction of Øystein Ore.[13][14] Her dissertation, \"New Types of Irreducibility Criteria\", was published that same year.[15] Hopper began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in 1941.[16]\\nShe was married to New York University professor Vincent Foster Hopper (1906–1976) from 1930 until their divorce in 1945.[13][17] She did not marry again, but chose to retain his surname.\\nCareer[edit]\\nWorld War II[edit]\\nHopper\\'s signatures on a duty officer signup sheet for the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard, which built and operated the Mark I\\nHopper had tried to enlist in the Navy early in World War II. She was rejected for a few reasons. At age 34, she was too old to enlist, and her weight to height ratio was too low. She was also denied on the basis that her job as a mathematician and mathematics professor at Vassar College was valuable to the war effort.[18] During the war in 1943, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve; she was one of many women who volunteered to serve in the WAVES. She had to get an exemption to enlist; she was 15 pounds (6.8\\xa0kg) below the Navy minimum weight of 120 pounds (54\\xa0kg). She reported in December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen\\'s School at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade. She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken. Hopper and Aiken co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Hopper\\'s request to transfer to the regular Navy at the end of the war was declined due to her advanced age of 38. She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve. Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at Vassar in favor of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard.[19]\\nHopper in a computer room in Washington, D.C., 1978, photographed by Lynn Gilbert\\nUNIVAC[edit]\\nIn 1949, Hopper became an employee of the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation as a senior mathematician and joined the team developing the UNIVAC I.[16]\\nHopper also served as UNIVAC director of Automatic Programming Development for Remington Rand. The UNIVAC was the first known large-scale electronic computer to be on the market in 1950,\\nand was more competitive at processing information than the Mark I.[20]\\nWhen Hopper recommended the development of a new programming language that would use entirely English words, she \"was told very quickly that [she] couldn\\'t do this because computers didn\\'t understand English.\" Her idea was not accepted for 3 years, and she published her first paper on the subject, compilers, in 1952. In the early 1950s, the company was taken over by the Remington Rand corporation, and it was while she was working for them that her original compiler work was done.\\nThe program was known as the A compiler and its first version was A-0.[21]:11\\nIn 1952, she had an operational link-loader, which at the time was referred to as a compiler. She later said that \"Nobody believed that,\" and that she \"had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic.\"[22] She goes on to say that her compiler \"translated mathematical notation into machine code. Manipulating symbols was fine for mathematicians but it was no good for data processors who were not symbol manipulators. Very few people are really symbol manipulators. If they are they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. It\\'s much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say \"Subtract income tax from pay\" instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols. COBOL is the major language used today in data processing.\"[23]\\nIn 1954 Hopper was named the company\\'s first director of automatic programming, and her department released some of the first compiler-based programming languages, including MATH-MATIC and FLOW-MATIC.[16]\\nCOBOL[edit]\\nHopper at the UNIVAC I console, c. 1960\\nIn the spring of 1959, computer experts from industry and government were brought together in a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL). Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language COBOL (an acronym for COmmon Business-Oriented Language). The new language extended Hopper\\'s FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent, COMTRAN.\\nHopper\\'s belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to English (rather than in machine code or in languages close to machine code, such as assembly languages) was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date.[24] Among the members of the committee that worked on COBOL was Mount Holyoke College alumnus Jean E. Sammet.[25]\\nFrom 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navy\\'s Office of Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1973.[19] She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy.[19]\\nStandards[edit]\\nIn the 1970s, Hopper advocated for the Defense Department to replace large, centralized systems with networks of small, distributed computers. Any user on any computer node could access common databases located on the network.[21]:119 She developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and components, most significantly for early programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL. The Navy tests for conformance to these standards led to significant convergence among the programming language dialects of the major computer vendors. In the 1980s, these tests (and their official administration) were assumed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), known today as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\\nRetirement[edit]\\nHopper being promoted to the rank of commodore in 1983\\nIn accordance with Navy attrition regulations, Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank of commander at age 60 at the end of 1966.[26]\\nShe was recalled to active duty in August 1967 for a six-month period that turned into an indefinite assignment.\\nShe again retired in 1971 but was again asked to return to active duty in 1972. She was promoted to captain in 1973 by Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr.[27]\\nAfter Republican Representative Philip Crane saw her on a March 1983 segment of 60 Minutes, he championed H.J.Res. 341, a joint resolution originating in the House of Representatives, which led to her promotion on 15 December 1983 to commodore by special Presidential appointment by President Ronald Reagan.[27][28][29][30] She remained on active duty for several years beyond mandatory retirement by special approval of Congress.[31]\\nEffective November 8, 1985, the rank of commodore was renamed rear admiral (lower half) and Hopper became one of the Navy\\'s few female admirals.\\nFollowing a career that spanned more than 42 years, Admiral Hopper took retirement from the Navy on August 14, 1986.[32] At a celebration held in Boston on the USS\\xa0Constitution to commemorate her retirement, Hopper was awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the highest non-combat decoration awarded by the Department of Defense.[33]\\nAt the time of her retirement, she was the oldest active-duty commissioned officer in the United States Navy (79 years, eight months and five days), and had her retirement ceremony aboard the oldest commissioned ship in the United States Navy (188 years, nine months and 23 days).[34]\\n(Admirals William D. Leahy, Chester W. Nimitz, Hyman G. Rickover and Charles Stewart were the only other officers in the Navy\\'s history to serve on active duty at a higher age.\\nLeahy and Nimitz served on active duty for life due to their promotions to the rank of fleet admiral.)\\nPost-retirement[edit]\\nFollowing her retirement from the Navy, she was hired as a senior consultant to Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Hopper was initially offered the job position by Rita Yavinsky, but she insisted on applying for the position at DEC, and going through the typical formal interview process. She also sent a letter to Yavinsky\\'s boss explaining that she would be available on alternating Thursdays, receiving a high salary, and have access to an unlimited expense account if she were to be exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer. After the proposal from Hopper, she was hired as a full-time senior consultant. As part of her position, she would report to Yavinsky. In this position, Hopper represented the company at industry forums, serving on various industry committees, along with other obligations.[10] She retained that position until her death at age 85 in 1992.\\nHopper was a goodwill ambassador in her primary activity in this capacity. She lectured widely about the early days of computing, her career, and on efforts that computer vendors could take to make life easier for their users. She visited most of Digital\\'s engineering facilities, where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks. Although no longer a serving officer, she always wore her Navy full dress uniform to these lectures (which is not allowed under U.S. Department of Defense regulation 32 CFR 53.2(a)(2)).\\n\"The most important thing I\\'ve accomplished, other than building the compiler,\" she said, \"is training young people.\" They come to me, you know, and say, \\'Do you think we can do this?\\' I say, \\'Try it.\\' And I back \\'em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir \\'em up at intervals so they don\\'t forget to take chances.\"[35]\\nAnecdotes[edit]\\nPhoto of \"first computer bug\" (a moth)\\nThroughout much of her later career, Hopper was much in demand as a speaker at various computer-related events. She was well known for her lively and irreverent speaking style, as well as a rich treasury of early war stories. She also received the nickname \"Grandma COBOL\".[36]\\nWhile she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University in 1947,[37] her associates discovered a moth that was stuck in a relay; the moth impeded the operation of the relay. While neither Hopper nor her crew mentioned the phrase \"debugging\" in their logs, the case was held as an instance of literal \"debugging.\" For many years, the term bug had been in use in engineering.[38][39] The remains of the moth can be found in the group\\'s log book at the Smithsonian Institution\\'s National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.[37]\\nGrace Hopper is famous for her nanoseconds visual aid. People (such as generals and admirals) used to ask her why satellite communication took so long.\\nShe started handing out pieces of wire that were just under one foot long (11.8 inches (30\\xa0cm))—the distance that light travels in one nanosecond. She gave these pieces of wire the metonym \"nanoseconds.\"[30]\\nShe was careful to tell her audience that the length of her nanoseconds was actually the maximum speed the signals would travel in a vacuum, and that signals would travel more slowly through the actual wires that were her teaching aids. Later she used the same pieces of wire to illustrate why computers had to be small to be fast.

His greatest achievement was the world\\'s first programmable computer; the functional program-controlled Turing-complete Z3 became operational in May 1941. Thanks to this machine and its predecessors, Zuse has often been regarded as the inventor of the modern computer.[2][3][4][5][6][7]\\nZuse was also noted for the S2 computing machine, considered the first process control computer. He founded one of the earliest computer businesses in 1941, producing the Z4, which became the world\\'s first commercial computer. From 1943[8] to 1945[9] he designed the first high-level programming language, Plankalkül.[10] In 1969, Zuse suggested the concept of a computation-based universe in his book Rechnender Raum (Calculating Space).\\nMuch of his early work was financed by his family and commerce, but after 1939 he was given resources by the Nazi German government.[11] Due to World War II, Zuse\\'s work went largely unnoticed in the United Kingdom and the United States. Possibly his first documented influence on a US company was IBM\\'s option on his patents in 1946.\\nThere is a replica of the Z3, as well as the original Z4, in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. The Deutsches Technikmuseum in Berlin has an exhibition devoted to Zuse, displaying twelve of his machines, including a replica of the Z1 and several of Zuse\\'s paintings.\\nContents\\n1 Pre-World War II work and the Z1\\n2 Z2, Z3, and Z4\\n3 S1 and S2\\n4 Plankalkül\\n5 Graphomat Z64 plotter\\n6 Helix tower\\n7 Personal life\\n8 Death\\n9 Zuse the entrepreneur\\n10 Calculating Space\\n11 Awards and honours\\n12 Zuse Year 2010\\n13 See also\\n14 References\\n15 Sources\\n16 Further reading\\n17 External links\\nPre-World War II work and the Z1\\nZuse Z1 replica in the German Museum of Technology in Berlin\\nBorn in Berlin on 22 June 1910, he moved with his family in 1912 to East Prussian Braunsberg (now Braniewo in Poland), where his father was a postal clerk. Zuse attended the Collegium Hosianum in Braunsberg. In 1923, the family moved to Hoyerswerda, where he passed his Abitur in 1928, qualifying him to enter university.\\nHe enrolled in the Technische Hochschule Berlin (now Technical University of Berlin) and explored both engineering and architecture, but found them boring. Zuse then pursued civil engineering, graduating in 1935. For a time, he worked for the Ford Motor Company, using his considerable artistic skills in the design of advertisements.[10] He started work as a design engineer at the Henschel aircraft factory in Schönefeld near Berlin. This required the performance of many routine calculations by hand, which he found mind-numbingly boring, leading him to dream of doing them by machine.\\nBeginning in 1935 he experimented in the construction of computers in his parents\\' flat on Wrangelstraße 38, moving with them into their new flat on Methfesselstraße 10, the street leading up the Kreuzberg, Berlin.[12] Working in his parents\\' apartment in 1936, he produced his first attempt, the Z1, a floating point binary mechanical calculator with limited programmability, reading instructions from a perforated 35\\xa0mm film.[10] In 1937, Zuse submitted two patents that anticipated a von Neumann architecture. He finished the Z1 in 1938. The Z1 contained some 30,000 metal parts and never worked well due to insufficient mechanical precision. On 30 January 1944, the Z1 and its original blueprints were destroyed with his parents\\' flat and many neighbouring buildings by a British air raid in World War II.[13]\\nBetween 1987 and 1989, Zuse recreated the Z1, suffering a heart attack midway through the project. It cost 800,000\\xa0DM, (approximately $500,000) and required four individuals (including Zuse) to assemble it. Funding for this retrocomputing project was provided by Siemens and a consortium of five companies.\\nZ2, Z3, and Z4\\nPlaque commemorating Zuse\\'s work, attached to the ruin of Methfesselstraße 7, Berlin Zuse completed his work entirely independently of other leading computer scientists and mathematicians of his day. Between 1936 and 1945, he was in near-total intellectual isolation.[14] In 1939, Zuse was called to military service, where he was given the resources to ultimately build the Z2.[11] In September 1940 Zuse presented the Z2, covering several rooms in the parental flat, to experts of the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt (DVL; i.e. German Research Institute for Aviation).[15] The Z2 was a revised version of the Z1 using telephone relays.\\nThe DVL granted research subsidies so that in 1941 Zuse started a company, Zuse Apparatebau (Zuse Apparatus Construction), to manufacture his machines,[16] renting a workshop on the opposite side in Methfesselstraße 7 and stretching through the block to Belle-Alliance Straße 29 (renamed and renumbered as Mehringdamm 84 in 1947).[12][17]\\nImproving on the basic Z2 machine, he built the Z3 in 1941. On 12 May 1941 Zuse presented the Z3, built in his workshop, to the public.[17][18] The Z3 was a binary 22-bit floating point calculator featuring programmability with loops but without conditional jumps, with memory and a calculation unit based on telephone relays. The telephone relays used in his machines were largely collected from discarded stock. Despite the absence of conditional jumps, the Z3 was a Turing complete computer. However, Turing-completeness was never considered by Zuse (who had practical applications in mind) and only demonstrated in 1998 (see History of computing hardware).\\nThe Z3, the first fully operational electromechanical computer, was partially financed by German government-supported DVL, which wanted their extensive calculations automated. A request by his co-worker Helmut Schreyer—who had helped Zuse build the Z3 prototype in 1938[19]—for government funding for an electronic successor to the Z3 was denied as \"strategically unimportant\".\\nStatue of Zuse in Bad Hersfeld In 1937, Schreyer had advised Zuse to use vacuum tubes as switching elements; Zuse at this time considered it a crazy idea (\"Schnapsidee\" in his own words). Zuse\\'s workshop on Methfesselstraße 7 (with the Z3) was destroyed in an Allied Air raid in late 1943 and the parental flat with Z1 and Z2 on 30 January the following year, whereas the successor Z4, which Zuse had begun constructing in 1942[20] in new premises in the Industriehof on Oranienstraße 6, remained intact.[21] On 3 February 1945, aerial bombing caused devastating destruction in the Luisenstadt, the area around Oranienstraße, including neighbouring houses.[22] This event effectively brought Zuse\\'s research and development to a complete halt. The partially finished, relay-based Z4 was packed and moved from Berlin on 14 February, only arriving in Göttingen two weeks later.[21]\\nWork on the Z4 could not be resumed immediately in the extreme privation of post-war Germany, and it was not until 1949 that he was able to resume work on it. He showed it to the mathematician Eduard Stiefel of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zürich) who ordered one in 1950. On 8 November 1949, Zuse KG was founded. The Z4 was delivered to ETH Zurich on 12 July 1950, and proved very reliable.[10]\\nS1 and S2\\nIn 1940, the German government began funding him through the Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt (AVA, Aerodynamic Research Institute, forerunner of the DLR),[23] which used his work for the production of glide bombs. Zuse built the S1 and S2 computing machines, which were special purpose devices which computed aerodynamic corrections to the wings of radio-controlled flying bombs. The S2 featured an integrated analog-to-digital converter under program control, making it the first process-controlled computer.[20]\\nThese machines contributed to the Henschel Werke Hs 293 and Hs 294 guided missiles developed by the German military between 1941 and 1945, which were the precursors to the modern cruise missile.[20][24][25] The circuit design of the S1 was the predecessor of Zuse\\'s Z11.[20] Zuse believed that these machines had been captured by occupying Soviet troops in 1945.[20]\\nPlankalkül\\nMain article: Plankalkül\\nWhile working on his Z4 computer, Zuse realised that programming in machine code was too complicated. He started working on a PhD thesis[26] containing groundbreaking research years ahead of its time, mainly the first high-level programming language, Plankalkül (\"Plan Calculus\") and, as an elaborate example program, the first real computer chess engine.[27] After the 1945 Luisenstadt bombing, he flew from Berlin for the rural Allgäu, and, unable to do any hardware development, he continued working on the Plankalkül, eventually publishing some brief excerpts of his thesis in 1948 and 1959; the work in its entirety, however, remained unpublished until 1972.[27] The PhD thesis was submitted at University of Augsburg, but rejected for formal reasons, because Zuse forgot to pay the 400 Mark university enrollment fee. (The rejection did not bother him.[28]) Plankalkül slightly influenced the design of ALGOL 58[29] but was itself implemented only in 1975 in a dissertation by Joachim Hohmann.[30] Heinz Rutishauser, one of the inventors of ALGOL, wrote: \"The very first attempt to devise an algorithmic language was undertaken in 1948 by K. Zuse. His notation was quite general, but the proposal never attained the consideration it deserved\". Further implementations followed in 1998 and then in 2000 by a team from the Free University of Berlin. Donald Knuth suggested a thought experiment: What might have happened had the bombing not taken place, and had the PhD thesis accordingly been published as planned?[27]\\nGraphomat Z64 plotter\\nZ64 Graphomat plotter\\nIn addition to his computing-related work, described above, Zuse began to work in 1956 on a high precision, large format plotter. It was demonstrated at the 1961 Hanover Fair,[31] and became well known also outside of the technical world thanks to Frieder Nake\\'s pioneering computer art work.[32]\\nOther plotters designed by Zuse include the ZUSE Z90 and ZUSE Z9004.[31]\\nHelix tower\\nIn the last years of his life, Zuse conceptualized and created a purely mechanical, extensible, modular tower automaton he named \"helix tower\" (\"Helixturm\"). The structure is based on a gear drive that employs rotary motion (e.g. provided by a crank) to assemble modular components from a storage space, elevating a tube-shaped tower; the process is reversible, and inverting the input direction will deconstruct the tower and store the components. The Deutsches Museum restored Zuse\\'s original 1:30 functional model that can be extended to a height of 2.7 m.[33] Zuse intended the full construction to reach a height of 120 m, and envisioned it for use with wind power generators and radio transmission installations.[34]\\nPersonal life\\nZuse Memorial in Hünfeld, Hessen\\nKonrad Zuse married Gisela Brandes in January 1945, employing a carriage, himself dressed in tailcoat and top hat and with Gisela in a wedding veil, for Zuse attached importance to a \"noble ceremony\". Their son Horst, the first of five children, was born in November 1945.\\nWhile Zuse never became a member of the Nazi Party, he is not known to have expressed any doubts or qualms about working for the Nazi war effort. Much later, he suggested that in modern times, the best scientists and engineers usually have to choose between either doing their work for more or less questionable business and military interests in a Faustian bargain, or not pursuing their line of work at all.[35]\\nAccording to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics, published by Genscher, Düsseldorf, there was a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse.[36] It took place in Göttingen in 1947. The encounter had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley, Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing. (For more details see Herbert Bruderer, Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz).\\nAfter he retired, he focused on his hobby of painting.[citation needed]\\nZuse was an atheist.[37][38]\\nDeath\\nZuse died on 18 December 1995 in Hünfeld, Hesse (near Fulda) from heart failure.\\nZuse the entrepreneur\\nZuse\\'s workshop at Neukirchen (photograph taken in January 2010)\\nMagnetic drum storage inside a Z31 (which was first displayed in 1963).\\nDuring World War 2, Zuse founded one of the earliest computer companies: the Zuse-Ingenieurbüro Hopferau. Capital was raised in 1946 through ETH Zurich and an IBM option on Zuse\\'s patents.\\nZuse founded another company, Zuse KG in Haunetal-Neukirchen in 1949; in 1957 the company\\'s head office moved to Bad Hersfeld. The Z4 was finished and delivered to the ETH Zurich, Switzerland in September 1950. At that time, it was the only working computer in continental Europe, and the second computer in the world to be sold, beaten only by the BINAC, which never worked properly after it was delivered. Other computers, all numbered with a leading Z, up to Z43,[39] were built by Zuse and his company. Notable are the Z11, which was sold to the optics industry and to universities, and the Z22, the first computer with a memory based on magnetic storage.[40]\\nBy 1967, the Zuse KG had built a total of 251 computers. Owing to financial problems, the company was then sold to Siemens.\\nCalculating Space\\nAn elementary process in Zuse\\'s Calculating Space: Two digital particles A und B form a new digital particle C.[41]\\nIn 1967, Zuse also suggested that the universe itself is running on a cellular automaton or similar computational structure (digital physics); in 1969, he published the book Rechnender Raum (translated into English as Calculating Space). This idea has attracted a lot of attention, since there is no physical evidence against Zuse\\'s thesis. Edward Fredkin (1980s), Jürgen Schmidhuber (1990s), and others have expanded on it.\\nAwards and honours\\nZuse received several awards for his work:\\nWerner von Siemens Ring in 1964 (together with Fritz Leonhardt and Walter Schottky)[42]\\nHarry H. Goode Memorial Award in 1965 (together with George Stibitz)\\nWilhelm Exner Medal in 1969.[1]\\nBundesverdienstkreuz in 1972 – Great Cross of Merit\\nComputer History Museum Fellow Award in 1999 \"for his invention of the first program-controlled, electromechanical, digital computer and the first high-level programming language, Plankalkül.\"[43]\\nThe Zuse Institute Berlin is named in his honour.\\nThe Konrad Zuse Medal of the Gesellschaft für Informatik, and the Konrad Zuse Medal of the Zentralverband des Deutschen Baugewerbes (Central Association of German Construction), are both named after Zuse.\\nZuse Year 2010\\nThe 100th anniversary of the birth of this computer pioneer was celebrated by exhibitions, lectures and workshops to remember his life and work and to bring attention to the importance of his invention to the digital age.[44][45] The movie Tron: Legacy, which revolves around a world inside a computer system, features a character named Zuse, presumably in honour of Konrad Zuse.[citation needed]\\nGerman posts DP AG issued a commemorative stamp at this occasion, June 6, 2010: a Zuse portrait, composed solely by the binary code numbers 1 and 0 in fine print.\\nSee also\\nZ5\\nZ23\\nZ25\\nDigital philosophy\\nList of pioneers in computer science\\nJohn Vincent Atanasoff\\nGerman inventors and discoverers\\nReferences\\n^ a b editor, ÖGV.

1953), often known by his initials, rms,[1] (also his email ID), and occasionally upper-case RMS, is an American free software movement activist and programmer. He campaigns for software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive the freedoms to use, study, distribute, and modify that software. Software that ensures these freedoms is termed free software. Stallman launched the GNU Project, founded the Free Software Foundation, developed the GNU Compiler Collection and GNU Emacs, and wrote the GNU General Public License.\\nStallman launched the GNU Project in September 1983 to create a Unix-like computer operating system composed entirely of free software.[2] With this, he also launched the free software movement. He has been the GNU project\\'s lead architect and organizer, and developed a number of pieces of widely used GNU software including, among others, the GNU Compiler Collection,[3] GNU Debugger,[4] and GNU Emacs text editor.[5] In October 1985[6] he founded the Free Software Foundation.\\nStallman pioneered the concept of copyleft, which uses the principles of copyright law to preserve the right to use, modify, and distribute free software, and is the main author of free software licenses which describe those terms, most notably the GNU General Public License (GPL), the most widely used free software license.[7]\\nIn 1989, he co-founded the League for Programming Freedom. Since the mid-1990s, Stallman has spent most of his time advocating for free software, as well as campaigning against software patents, digital rights management (which he referred to as digital restrictions management, calling the more common term misleading), and other legal and technical systems which he sees as taking away users\\' freedoms. This has included software license agreements, non-disclosure agreements, activation keys, dongles, copy restriction, proprietary formats, and binary executables without source code.\\nContents\\n1 Early life\\n1.1 Harvard University and MIT\\n2 Events leading to GNU\\n3 GNU project\\n4 Activism\\n4.1 Copyright reduction\\n4.2 Surveillance resistance\\n5 Terminology\\n5.1 Rejections\\n5.1.1 Open source for free software\\n5.1.2 Linux for the GNU Project\\n6 Personal life\\n7 Honors and awards\\n8 Selected publications\\n9 See also\\n10 References\\n11 External links\\nEarly life[edit]\\nStallman was born March 16, 1953,[8] in New York City, to a family of Jewish heritage.[9] His parents are Alice Lippman, a school teacher, and Daniel Stallman, a printing press broker. Stallman had a difficult relationship with his parents, as his father had a drinking habit and verbally abused his stepmother. He later came to describe his parents as \"tyrants\".[10] He was interested in computers at a young age; when Stallman was a pre-teen at a summer camp, he read manuals for the IBM 7094.[11] From 1967 to 1969, Stallman attended a Columbia University Saturday program for high school students.[11] Stallman was also a volunteer laboratory assistant in the biology department at Rockefeller University. Although he was interested in mathematics and physics, his teaching professor at Rockefeller thought he showed promise as a biologist.[12]\\nHis first experience with actual computers was at the IBM New York Scientific Center when he was in high school. He was hired for the summer in 1970, following his senior year of high school, to write a numerical analysis program in Fortran.[11] He completed the task after a couple of weeks (\"I swore that I would never use FORTRAN again because I despised it as a language compared with other languages\") and spent the rest of the summer writing a text editor in APL[13] and a preprocessor for the PL/I programming language on the IBM System/360.[14]\\nHarvard University and MIT[edit]\\nAs a first-year student at Harvard University in fall 1970, Stallman was known for his strong performance in Math 55.[15] He was happy: \"For the first time in my life, I felt I had found a home at Harvard.\"[11]\\nIn 1971, near the end of his first year at Harvard, he became a programmer at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and became a regular in the hacker community, where he was usually known by his initials, RMS (which he used in his computer accounts).[1][16] Stallman received a bachelor\\'s degree in physics (magna cum laude) from Harvard in 1974.[17]\\nStallman considered staying on at Harvard, but instead he decided to enroll as a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He pursued a doctorate in physics for one year, but left that program to focus on his programming at the MIT AI Laboratory.[11][14]\\nWhile working (starting in 1975) as a research assistant at MIT under Gerry Sussman,[14] Stallman published a paper (with Sussman) in 1977 on an AI truth maintenance system, called dependency-directed backtracking.[18] This paper was an early work on the problem of intelligent backtracking in constraint satisfaction problems. As of 2009[update], the technique Stallman and Sussman introduced is still the most general and powerful form of intelligent backtracking.[19] The technique of constraint recording, wherein partial results of a search are recorded for later reuse, was also introduced in this paper.[19]\\nAs a hacker in MIT\\'s AI laboratory, Stallman worked on software projects such as TECO, Emacs for ITS, and the Lisp machine operating system (the CONS of 1974–1976 and the CADR of 1977–1979—this latter unit was commercialized by Symbolics and LMI starting around 1980).[16] He would become an ardent critic of restricted computer access in the lab, which at that time was funded primarily by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). When MIT\\'s Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) installed a password control system in 1977, Stallman found a way to decrypt the passwords and sent users messages containing their decoded password, with a suggestion to change it to the empty string (that is, no password) instead, to re-enable anonymous access to the systems. Around 20 percent of the users followed his advice at the time, although passwords ultimately prevailed. Stallman boasted of the success of his campaign for many years afterward.[20]\\nEvents leading to GNU[edit]\\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the hacker culture that Stallman thrived on began to fragment. To prevent software from being used on their competitors\\' computers, most manufacturers stopped distributing source code and began using copyright and restrictive software licenses to limit or prohibit copying and redistribution. Such proprietary software had existed before, and it became apparent that it would become the norm. This shift in the legal characteristics of software was a consequence triggered by the US Copyright Act of 1976.[21]\\nWhen Brian Reid in 1979 placed time bombs in the Scribe markup language and word processing system to restrict unlicensed access to the software, Stallman proclaimed it \"a crime against humanity\".[14] During an interview in 2008, he clarified that it is blocking the user\\'s freedom that he believes is a crime, not the issue of charging for software.[22] Stallman\\'s texinfo is a GPL replacement, loosely based on Scribe;[23] the original version was finished in 1986.[24]\\nIn 1980, Stallman and some other hackers at the AI Lab were refused access to the source code for the software of a newly installed laser printer, the Xerox 9700. Stallman had modified the software for the Lab\\'s previous laser printer (the XGP, Xerographic Printer), so it electronically messaged a user when the person\\'s job was printed, and would message all logged-in users waiting for print jobs if the printer was jammed. Not being able to add these features to the new printer was a major inconvenience, as the printer was on a different floor from most of the users. This experience convinced Stallman of people\\'s need to be able to freely modify the software they use.[25]\\nRichard Greenblatt, a fellow AI Lab hacker, founded Lisp Machines, Inc. (LMI) to market Lisp machines, which he and Tom Knight designed at the lab. Greenblatt rejected outside investment, believing that the proceeds from the construction and sale of a few machines could be profitably reinvested in the growth of the company. In contrast, the other hackers felt that the venture capital-funded approach was better. As no agreement could be reached, hackers from the latter camp founded Symbolics, with the aid of Russ Noftsker, an AI Lab administrator. Symbolics recruited most of the remaining hackers including notable hacker Bill Gosper, who then left the AI Lab. Symbolics also forced Greenblatt to resign by citing MIT policies. While both companies delivered proprietary software, Stallman believed that LMI, unlike Symbolics, had tried to avoid hurting the lab\\'s community. For two years, from 1982 to the end of 1983, Stallman worked by himself to clone the output of the Symbolics programmers, with the aim of preventing them from gaining a monopoly on the lab\\'s computers.[20]\\nStallman argues that software users should have the freedom to share with their neighbors and be able to study and make changes to the software that they use. He maintains that attempts by proprietary software vendors to prohibit these acts are antisocial and unethical.[26] The phrase \"software wants to be free\" is often incorrectly attributed to him, and Stallman argues that this is a misstatement of his philosophy.[27] He argues that freedom is vital for the sake of users and society as a moral value, and not merely for pragmatic reasons such as possibly developing technically superior software.[28] Eric S. Raymond, one of the creators of the open-source movement,[29] argues that moral arguments, rather than pragmatic ones, alienate potential allies and hurt the end goal of removing code secrecy.[30]\\nIn February 1984, Stallman quit his job at MIT to work full-time on the GNU project, which he had announced in September 1983. Since then, he has remained affiliated with MIT as an unpaid[31] visiting scientist in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.[32] Until \"around 1998\", he maintained an office at the Institute that doubled as his legal residence.[33]\\nGNU project[edit]\\nMain article: GNU Project\\nStallman announced the plan for the GNU operating system in September 1983 on several ARPANET mailing lists and USENET[2][34]. He started the project on his own and describes: \"As an operating system developer, I had the right skills for this job. So even though I could not take success for granted, I realized that I was elected to do the job. I chose to make the system compatible with Unix so that it would be portable, and so that Unix users could easily switch to it.\"[35]\\nStallman in 2003 at the opening ceremony of NIXAL (a GLUG) at Netaji Subhash Engineering College, Calcutta, India\\nIn 1985, Stallman published the GNU Manifesto, which outlined his motivation for creating a free operating system called GNU, which would be compatible with Unix.[16] The name GNU is a recursive acronym for \"GNU\\'s Not Unix\".[16] Soon after, he started a nonprofit corporation called the Free Software Foundation to employ free software programmers and provide a legal infrastructure for the free software movement. Stallman is the nonsalaried president of the FSF, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded in Massachusetts.[36] Stallman popularized the concept of copyleft, a legal mechanism to protect the modification and redistribution rights for free software. It was first implemented in the GNU Emacs General Public License, and in 1989 the first program-independent GNU General Public License (GPL) was released. By then, much of the GNU system had been completed.\\nStallman was responsible for contributing many necessary tools, including a text editor (Emacs), compiler (GCC), debugger (GNU Debugger), and a build automator (GNU make). The notable omission was a kernel. In 1990, members of the GNU project began using Carnegie Mellon\\'s Mach microkernel in a project called GNU Hurd, which has yet to achieve the maturity level required for full POSIX compliance.\\nIn 1991, Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, used the GNU\\'s development tools to produce the free monolithic Linux kernel. The existing programs from the GNU project were readily ported to run on the resultant platform. Most sources use the name Linux to refer to the general-purpose operating system thus formed, while Stallman and the FSF call it GNU/Linux. This has been a longstanding naming controversy in the free software community. Stallman argues that not using GNU in the name of the operating system unfairly disparages the value of the GNU project and harms the sustainability of the free software movement by breaking the link between the software and the free software philosophy of the GNU project.\\nCover picture for O\\'Reilly Media\\'s book Free as in Freedom\\nStallman\\'s influences on hacker culture include the name POSIX[37] and the Emacs editor. On Unix systems, GNU Emacs\\'s popularity rivaled that of another editor vi, spawning an editor war. Stallman\\'s take on this was to canonize himself as St. IGNUcius of the Church of Emacs[38][39] and acknowledge that \"vi vi vi is the editor of the beast\", while \"using a free version of vi is not a sin; it is a penance\".[40] On his homepage Stallman explains what a life in the Church of Emacs means to its members: \"Sainthood in the Church of Emacs requires living a life of purity—but in the Church of Emacs, this does not require celibacy (a sigh of relief is heard)\".[39]\\nIn 1992, developers at Lucid Inc. doing their own work on Emacs clashed with Stallman and ultimately forked the software into what would become XEmacs.[41] The technology journalist Andrew Leonard has characterized what he sees as Stallman\\'s uncompromising stubbornness as common among elite computer programmers:\\n.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}There\\'s something comforting about Stallman\\'s intransigence. Win or lose, Stallman will never give up. He\\'ll be the stubbornest mule on the farm until the day he dies. Call it fixity of purpose, or just plain cussedness, his single-minded commitment and brutal honesty are refreshing in a world of spin-meisters and multimillion-dollar marketing campaigns.[42]\\nActivism[edit]\\nStallman has written many essays on software freedom, and has been an outspoken political campaigner for the free software movement since the early 1990s.[16] The speeches he has regularly given are titled The GNU Project and the Free Software Movement,[43] The Dangers of Software Patents,[44] and Copyright and Community in the Age of Computer Networks.[45] In 2006 and 2007, during the eighteen month public consultation for the drafting of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, he added a fourth topic explaining the proposed changes.[46]\\nLinus Torvalds has criticized Stallman for what he considers \"black-and-white thinking\".[47]\\nStallman\\'s staunch advocacy for free software inspired the creation of the Virtual Richard M. Stallman (vrms), software that analyzes the packages currently installed on a Debian GNU/Linux system, and reports those that are from the non-free tree.[48] Stallman disagrees with parts of Debian\\'s definition of free software.[49]\\nIn 1999, Stallman called for development of a free online encyclopedia through the means of inviting the public to contribute articles.[50] The resulting GNUPedia was eventually retired in favour of the emerging Wikipedia, which had similar aims and was enjoying greater success.[51]\\nStallman is a world traveler and has visited at least 65 countries, mostly to speak about free software and the GNU project.[52] According to Stallman, the free software movement has much in common with that of Mahatma Gandhi.[53] Stallman is also highly critical of the effect that drug patents have had on developing countries.[54][55]\\nStallman giving a speech on \"Free Software and Your Freedom\" at the biennale du design of Saint-Étienne (2008)\\nIn Venezuela, Stallman has delivered public speeches and promoted the adoption of free software in the state\\'s oil company (PDVSA), in municipal government, and in the nation\\'s military. In meetings with Hugo Chávez and in public speeches, Stallman criticised some policies on television broadcasting, free speech rights, and privacy.[56][57] Stallman was on the Advisory Council of Latin American television station teleSUR from its launch[58] but resigned in February 2011, criticizing pro-Gaddafi propaganda during the Arab Spring.[59]\\nIn August 2006, at his meetings with the government of the Indian State of Kerala, he persuaded officials to discard proprietary software, such as Microsoft\\'s, at state-run schools. This has resulted in a landmark decision to switch all school computers in 12,500 high schools from Windows to a free software operating system.[60]\\nAfter personal meetings, Stallman obtained positive statements about the free software movement from the then-president of India, A.\\xa0P.\\xa0J. Abdul Kalam,[61] French 2007 presidential candidate Ségolène Royal,[62] and the president of Ecuador Rafael Correa.[63]\\nOn November 30, 2012, Stallman gave the opening lecture at the Goiano Free Software Forum in Brazil, talking about successful cases of switching to free software in government, business and at universities.[64]\\nStallman has participated in protests about software patents,[65] digital rights management,[66][67] and proprietary software.\\nProtesting against proprietary software in April 2006, Stallman held a \"Don\\'t buy from ATI, enemy of your freedom\" placard at a speech by an ATI representative in the building where Stallman worked, resulting in the police being called.[68] ATI has since merged with AMD Corporation and has taken steps to make their hardware documentation available for use by the free software community.[69]\\nIn response to Apple\\'s Macintosh look and feel lawsuits against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard in 1988, Stallman called for a boycott of Apple products on the grounds that a successful look-and-feel lawsuit would \"put an end to free software that could substitute for commercial software\".[70] The boycott was lifted in 1995, which meant the FSF started to accept patches to GNU software for Apple operating systems.[71]\\nStallman using his Lemote machine at Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai\\nStallman has characterized Steve Jobs as having a \"malign influence\" on computing because of Jobs\\' leadership in guiding Apple to produce closed platforms.[72][73] In 1993, while Jobs was at NeXT, Jobs asked Stallman if he could distribute a modified GCC in two parts, one part under GPL and the other part, an Objective-C preprocessor under a proprietary license. Stallman initially thought this would be legal, but since he also thought it would be \"very undesirable for free software\", he asked a lawyer for advice. The response he got was that judges would consider such schemes to be \"subterfuges\" and would be very harsh toward them, and a judge would ask whether it was \"really\" one program, rather than how the parts were labeled. Therefore, Stallman sent a message back to Jobs which said they believed Jobs\\' plan was not allowed by the GPL, which resulted in NeXT releasing the Objective-C front end under GPL.[74]\\nCommenting on Jobs\\' death, he said, \"As Chicago Mayor Harold Washington said of the corrupt former Mayor Daley, \\'I\\'m not glad he\\'s dead, but I\\'m glad he\\'s gone.\\'\"[73]\\nStallman\\'s remark stirred up accusations of being in bad taste, while Eric S. Raymond, author of The Cathedral and the Bazaar, observed that Stallman\\'s statement was not personal, but was simply criticizing walled gardens.[72]\\nFor a period of time, Stallman used a notebook from the One Laptop per Child program. Stallman\\'s computer is a refurbished ThinkPad T400s with Libreboot, a free BIOS replacement, and the GNU/Linux distribution Trisquel.[75] Before the ThinkPad T400s, Stallman used a Thinkpad X60 with Libreboot and Trisquel GNU/Linux.[76] And before the X60, Stallman used the Lemote Yeeloong netbook (using the same company\\'s Loongson processor) which he chose because, like the X60 and the T400s, it could run with free software at the BIOS level, stating \"freedom is my priority. I\\'ve campaigned for freedom since 1983, and I am not going to surrender that freedom for the sake of a more convenient computer.\"[77] Stallman\\'s Lemote was stolen from him in 2012 while in Argentina.[78] Before Trisquel, Stallman has used the gNewSense operating system.[79][80]\\nCopyright reduction[edit]\\nStallman has regularly given a talk entitled \"Copyright vs. Community\" where he reviews the state of digital rights management (DRM) and names many of the products and corporations which he boycotts. His approach to DRM is best summed up by the FSF Defective by Design campaign. In the talks, he makes proposals for a \"reduced copyright\" and suggests a 10-year limit on copyright. He suggests that, instead of restrictions on sharing, authors be supported using a tax, with revenues distributed among them based on cubic roots of their popularity to ensure that \"fairly successful non-stars\" receive a greater share than they do now (compare with private copying levy which is associated with proponents of strong copyright), or a convenient anonymous micropayment system for people to support authors directly. He indicates that no form of non-commercial sharing of copies should be considered a copyright violation.[81][82] He has advocated civil disobedience in a comment on Ley Sinde.[82][83]\\nStallman has also helped and supported the International Music Score Library Project in getting back online, after it had been taken down on October 19, 2007, following a cease and desist letter from Universal Edition.[84]\\nStallman at Swatantra 2014, a conference organized by ICFOSS in Kerala, India\\nStallman mentions the dangers some e-books bring compared to paper books, with the example of the Amazon Kindle e-reader that prevents the copying of e-books and allows Amazon to order automatic deletion of a book. He says that such e-books present a big step backward with respect to paper books by being less easy to use, copy, lend to others or sell, also mentioning that Amazon e-books cannot be bought anonymously. His short story \"The Right to Read\" provides a picture of a dystopian future if the right to share books is impeded. He objects to many of the terms within typical end-user license agreements that accompany e-books.[82][84][85]\\nStallman discourages the use of several storage technologies such as DVD or Blu-ray video discs because the content of such media is encrypted. He considers manufacturers\\' use of encryption on non-secret data (to force the user to view certain promotional material) as a conspiracy.[86]\\nHe recognized the Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal to be a criminal act by Sony. Stallman supports a general boycott of Sony for its legal actions against George Hotz.[87]\\nStallman has suggested that the United States government may encourage the use of software as a service because this would allow them to access users\\' data without needing a search warrant.[88][89][90][91]\\nHe denies being an anarchist despite his wariness of some legislation and the fact that he has \"advocated strongly for user privacy and his own view of software freedom\".[92]\\nSurveillance resistance[edit]\\nStallman professes admiration for whistleblowers Julian Assange[93] and Edward Snowden;[94] he advocates for Snowden in a prefix at the beginning of each of his emails, which can be found in several mailing lists, after Snowden leaked the PRISM scandal in 2013: \"To any NSA and FBI agents reading my email: please consider whether defending the US Constitution against all enemies, foreign or domestic, requires you to follow Snowden\\'s example.\"\\nTerminology[edit]\\nStallman, in costume as St. IGNUcius, wears a halo consisting of the platter of an old hard disk drive.[39] (Monastir, Tunisia, 2012)\\nStallman places great importance on the words and labels people use to talk about the world, including the relationship between software and freedom. He asks people to say free software and GNU/Linux, and to avoid the terms intellectual property and piracy (in relation to copyright). One of his criteria for giving an interview to a journalist is that the journalist agree to use his terminology throughout the article.[95] He has been known to turn down speaking requests over some terminology issues.[96]\\nStallman argues that the term intellectual property is designed to confuse people, and is used to prevent intelligent discussion on the specifics of copyright, patent, trademark, and other laws by lumping together areas of law that are more dissimilar than similar.[97] He also argues that by referring to these laws as property laws, the term biases the discussion when thinking about how to treat these issues, writing:\\nThese laws originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues. Copyright law was designed to promote authorship and art, and covers the details of a work of authorship or art. Patent law was intended to encourage publication of ideas, at the price of finite monopolies over these ideas\\xa0– a price that may be worth paying in some fields and not in others. Trademark law was not intended to promote any business activity, but simply to enable buyers to know what they are buying.[98]\\nAn example of cautioning others to avoid other terminology while also offering suggestions for possible alternatives is this sentence of an e-mail by Stallman to a public mailing list:\\nI think it is ok for authors (please let\\'s not call them creators, they are not gods) to ask for money for copies of their works (please let\\'s not devalue these works by calling them content) in order to gain income (the term compensation falsely implies it is a matter of making up for some kind of damages).[99]\\nRejections[edit]\\nOpen source for free software[edit]\\nHis requests that people use certain terms, and his ongoing efforts to convince people of the importance of terminology, are a source of regular misunderstanding and friction with parts of the free software and open-source communities.\\nAfter initially accepting the concept,[100] Stallman rejects a common alternative term, open-source software, because it does not call to mind what Stallman sees as the value of the software: freedom.[101] He wrote, \"Free software is a political movement; open source is a development model.\"[102] Thus, he believes that the use of the term will not inform people of the freedom issues, and will not lead to people valuing and defending their freedom.[103] Two alternatives which Stallman does accept are software libre and unfettered software, but free software is the term he asks people to use in English. For similar reasons, he argues for the term proprietary software rather than closed-source software, when referring to software that is not free software.\\nLinux for the GNU Project[edit]\\nMain article: GNU/Linux naming controversy\\nStallman asks that the term GNU/Linux, which he pronounces /ɡnuː slæʃ ˈlɪnəks/ GNOO SLASH LIN-əks, be used to refer to the operating system created by combining the GNU system and the kernel Linux. Stallman refers to this operating system as \"a variant of GNU, and the GNU Project is its principal developer\".[96] He claims that the connection between the GNU project\\'s philosophy and its software is broken when people refer to the combination as merely Linux.[104]\\nStarting around 2003, he began also using the term GNU+Linux, which he pronounces /ɡnuː plʌs ˈlɪnəks/ GNOO PLUS LIN-əks, to prevent others from pronouncing the phrase GNU/Linux as /ɡnuː ˈlɪnəks/ GNOO LIN-əks, which would erroneously imply that the kernel Linux is maintained by the GNU project.[citation needed] . The creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds, has publicly stated that he objects to modification of the name, and that the rename \"is their[the FSF] confusion not ours\".[105]\\nPersonal life[edit]\\nStallman has said that he is \"an atheist of Jewish ancestry\"[9] and often wears a button that reads \"Impeach God\".[15][106]\\nStallman refers to mobile phones as \"portable surveillance and tracking devices\",[107] refusing to own a cell phone due to the lack of phones running entirely on free software.[108] He also avoids using a key card to enter his office building[52] since key card systems track each location and time that someone enters the building using a card. According to Stallman, with the exception of a few sites, such as his own website or sites related to his work with GNU and the FSF, he usually does not browse the web directly from his personal computer in order to prevent being connected with his browsing history. Instead, he uses GNU Womb\\'s grab-url-from-mail utility, which can run on a separate system, and act as an email-based proxy to web sites: the user sends an e-mail which the script receives, the remote system downloads the web page content, and then the script emails the user the web page content.[109][110] More recently he stated that he accesses all web sites via Tor, except for Wikipedia (which generally disallows editing from Tor).[111][112]\\nStallman is openly childfree.[113] He has urged others to not have children, viewing it as objectionable for reasons centered on family tensions and overpopulation.[113] He argues that not having children better liberates people to find more productive ways to \"make a positive contribution to the world\".[113]\\nStallman has written a collection of filk and parody songs, granting unlimited permission to sing and perform them.[114]\\nAccording to his lifestyle FAQ, he enjoys science fiction.[115]\\nHe speaks English, French, Spanish and some Indonesian.[33]\\nStallman resides in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[33]\\nHonors and awards[edit]\\nStallman has received recognition for his work, including:\\n1986: Honorary lifetime membership of the Chalmers University of Technology Computer Society[116]\\n1990: Exceptional merit award MacArthur Fellowship (\"genius grant\")[117]\\n1990: The Association for Computing Machinery\\'s Grace Murray Hopper Award \"For pioneering work in the development of the extensible editor EMACS (Editing Macros)\"[118]\\n1996: Honorary doctorate from Sweden\\'s Royal Institute of Technology[119]\\n1998: Electronic Frontier Foundation\\'s Pioneer award[120]\\n1999: Yuri Rubinsky Memorial Award[121]\\n2001: The Takeda Techno-Entrepreneurship Award for Social/Economic Well-Being (武田研究奨励賞)[122][123]\\n2001: Honorary doctorate, from the University of Glasgow[124]\\n2002: United States National Academy of Engineering membership[125]\\n2003: Honorary doctorate, from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel[126]\\n2004: Honorary doctorate, from the Universidad Nacional de Salta[127]\\n2004: Honorary professorship, from the Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería del Perú[128]\\n2007: Honorary professorship, from the Universidad Inca Garcilaso de la Vega\\xa0[es] [2][129]\\n2007: First Premio Internacional Extremadura al Conocimiento Libre[130]\\n2007: Honorary doctorate, from the Universidad de Los Angeles de Chimbote[131]\\n2007: Honorary doctorate, from the University of Pavia[132]\\n2008: Honorary doctorate from the Universidad Nacional de Trujillo, in Peru[citation needed]\\n2009: Honorary doctorate, from Lakehead University[133][134]\\n2011: Honorary doctorate, from National University of Córdoba[135]\\n2012: Honorary professorship, from the Universidad César Vallejo de Trujillo, in Peru[citation needed]\\n2012: Honorary doctorate, from the Universidad Latinoamericana Cima de Tacna, in Peru[citation needed]\\n2012: Honorary doctorate, from the Universidad José Faustino Sánchez Carrió, in Peru[citation needed]\\n2014: Honorary doctorate, from Concordia University, in Montréal[136]\\n2015: ACM Software System Award \"For the development and leadership of GCC\"[118]\\n2016: Honorary doctorate, from Pierre and Marie Curie University[137]\\n2016: Social Medicine award, from GNU Solidario[138]\\nSelected publications[edit]\\nManuals\\nStallman, Richard M (1980).
